Over the past couple of weeks, I finally bit the bullet and decided to move my most prevelant personal project into VSTS: this blog.</p>\n<p>This post covers the setup, and more specifically what I use to produce my lovely blog. We’ll get into the thick of it in <a href=\"https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-2/\">part 2</a>.</p>\n<h3>Woah. VSTS <em>just</em> for a Blog?</h3>\n<p>I know. Let me address this first before we continue.</p>\n<p>It’s definitely overkill. But, it provided me with a great learning experience for VSTS and the application lifecycle management tools is provides. It also was something that I’ll actually use on a regular basis, as you’ll see if you get through the whole series of posts.</p>\n<p>So, yes it’s like using a grenade launcher to kill an ant. That being said, it definitely gets the job done.</p>\n<h2>The Parts</h2>\n<p>Here’s what I use in my blog project, and what you’ll need if you’re going to follow along.</p>\n<h3>Hexo or another Static Site Generator</h3>\n<p>If you’re not familiar with static site generators, they are great for developers looking to blog or create simple sites. I won’t be going into the details on how to use one, but they all seem to provide a similar sort of experience.</p>\n<p>All you do is add files, generally in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\">Markdown</a>, fill out the configuration file, and run the generate command. The generator then generates a series of static HTML files from your content and then you have the files you need to publish to a web server somewhere.</p>\n<p>No server-side code, no database, just a bunch of files. Real simple.</p>\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://hexo.io/\">Hexo</a> for my <a href=\"https://blog.davidwesst.com\">blog</a>, and it is used for the <a href=\"http://www.westerndevs.com\">Western Devs</a> site. It works well, and makes scripting your build and deployment (<a href=\"https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-3/\">which we’ll see later</a>) much easier.</p>\n<p>If you don’t like Hexo then take a <a href=\"https://www.staticgen.com/\">look here</a> for a bunch of static site generators based in a variety of languages.</p>\n<h3>Visual Studio Team Services Account</h3>\n<p>Sign up for the free account <a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/vsts-test/\">here</a> and create a new team project. I used the <em>Agile</em> process because I found it gave me the flexibility I wanted, and <em>Git</em> for source control.</p>\n<p>If you want more details about the project processes available, and the differences between them, take a look at <a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/work/guidance/choose-process\">this link</a>.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 287px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/f7b254bb4215182a194cc19fb2b5cedf/480fd/CYlb9sNm.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 111.39240506329114%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"&quot;Create a New Project in VSTS&quot;\"\n        title=\"&quot;Create a New Project in VSTS&quot;\"\n        src=\"/static/f7b254bb4215182a194cc19fb2b5cedf/480fd/CYlb9sNm.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f7b254bb4215182a194cc19fb2b5cedf/c26ae/CYlb9sNm.png 158w,\n/static/f7b254bb4215182a194cc19fb2b5cedf/480fd/CYlb9sNm.png 287w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h3>Web Host</h3>\n<p>Just like any website, you’re going to need a place to host it. Lucky for us, we’re only hosting static files which makes the options pretty open.</p>\n<p>I’m using Windows Azure, which again is overkill considering it’s just static files, but I like it. If you don’t want to spend money, I have also used <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> which is free and works just as well for what we’ll be doing.</p>\n<p>The important part is having a place to host the files once they are generated. No more, no less.</p>\n<h3>Web Browser</h3>\n<p>VSTS is browser-based, so get a your favourite modern browser, get it updated, and you’re good to go.</p>\n<h3>Code Editor</h3>\n<p>We’re not going to be doing much code, but it’ll come in handy later on.</p>\n<p>Personally, I jump between <a href=\"http://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/\">Vim</a>. I’m sure you have your favourite, and that’ll do just fine for our purposes.</p>\n<h2>You Forgot Visual Studio</h2>\n<p>No I didn’t. I don’t use Visual Studio, nor do we need it.</p>\n<p>It’s not that I don’t like it, but it’s too heavy for the amount of coding I actually do for my blog. VSTS provides us with a web-based user interface that does everything we need for managing the source code, builds, and so on.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I don’t use Visual Studio here because I don’t need it.</p>\n<h2>And We’re Ready</h2>\n<p>Armed with our toolbox of goodies and our project created, we’re good to go on starting to blog with VSTS. <a href=\"https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-2/\">Next up</a>, we’ll starting with what is familiar and getting our code into VSTS.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/how-to-blog-with-vsts-part-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Blog with VSTS (Part 1)","tags":["visual studio team services","vsts","alm","hexo"],"categories":["development"],"date":"October 31, 2016","description":null,"excerpt":"I wanted to understand how to use Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) for a \"real\" project.
