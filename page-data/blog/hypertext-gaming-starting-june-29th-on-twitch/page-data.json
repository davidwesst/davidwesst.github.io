Nothing more, nothing less.</p>\n<h4>What to expect?</h4>\n<p>The format is still up in the air, but for now I have the plan to play HTML games, have some HTML-related guests join me live for the conversation (and play games), and then a bit of a technical deeper dive in HTML games by playing around with different tools to see what is out there with respect to game development in the HTML space.</p>\n<h4>Where to find it?</h4>\n<p>You can watch it live on <a href=\"http://twitch.tv/hypertextgaming\">Twitch</a> or watch replays on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/hypertextgaming\">YouTube</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also join the conversation on <a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/hypertextgaminig\">Reddit</a> and suggest games for me to play or topics/themes you’d like to see on stream.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/hypertext-gaming-starting-june-29th-on-twitch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hypertext Gaming - Starting June 29th on Twitch","tags":["twitch","html5"],"categories":["projects"],"date":"June 24, 2014","description":null,"excerpt":null,"social_image":null}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Whatcha doin' DW?"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/whatcha-doin-dw/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Back to Basics: The Text Editor"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/back-to-basics-the-text-editor/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/hypertext-gaming-starting-june-29th-on-twitch/","prevSlug":"/blog/whatcha-doin-dw/","nextSlug":"/blog/back-to-basics-the-text-editor/"}},
