My personal favourite is the <a href=\"http://play.nintendo.com/activities/activities/mario-kart-8-party-starter/\">Mario Kart 8 Party Starter</a> built on a canvas, or the “surprise” that happens when you click the question mark box (see above).</p>\n<p><img src=\"playnintendo-mariopartystarter.PNG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I know it’s nothing major for an entertainment company create an interactive HTML5 web site and application, but I feel as though this is something big for a company like Nintendo to do this.</p>\n<p>I’ve loved Nintendo for years, since I was a kid in fact. But (like many other video game companies) websites are not engaging, rather just informative places.</p>\n<p>There’s nothing wrong with that, as the web is just that a whole whack of documents.</p>\n<p>But to see a big player, like Nintendo, take a leap into the rich and engaging modern web, I need to highlight it and applaud them for their effort.</p>\n<h3>Next Steps for Nintendo</h3>\n<p>You need to embrace your fan community out there and let things like <a href=\"https://github.com/Diogenesthecynic/FullScreenMario\">FullScreenMario</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fullscreenpokemon.com/\">FullScreenPokemon</a> become part of your web presence, rather than <a href=\"http://www.fullscreenmario.com/\">killing them off</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"fullscreenpokemon.PNG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Thanks for Playing. ~ DW</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/nintendo-builds-rich-html5-experiences/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nintendo Builds Rich HTML5 Experiences","tags":["games","html5"],"categories":["video games","technology"],"date":"October 02, 2014","description":null,"excerpt":"I need to throw a shout out to Nintendo.","social_image":null}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Why do you RequireJS?"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/why-do-you-requirejs/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Why do you CoffeeScript your JavaScript?"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/why-do-you-coffeescript-your-javascript/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/nintendo-builds-rich-html5-experiences/","prevSlug":"/blog/why-do-you-requirejs/","nextSlug":"/blog/why-do-you-coffeescript-your-javascript/"}},
