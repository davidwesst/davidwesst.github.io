The solution entails using a test build of the new Docker tool suite, so use at your own risk, but it does work!</p>\n<p>You can find the solution from Dave White <a href=\"http://www.westerndevs.com/getting-docker-running-on-windows-10/\">here</a>, and learn more about the man himself <a href=\"http://www.westerndevs.com/bios/dave_white/\">here</a>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/08/Docker-on-Windows-10-Problems/docker-logo.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I’ve hit some issues getting docker running on Windows 10. Turns out it’s an issue with VirtualBox and it’s being worked on, but I figured I’d share the details here just in case you’re having the same issue.</p>\n<p>You get the full scoop <a href=\"https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/1015\">here on GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/14040\">here on the Virtualbox ticket site</a>.</p>\n<p>For those too busy to read the links, here’s the executive summary.</p>\n<h3>The Symptoms</h3>\n<p>You install <a href=\"http://boot2docker.io\">boot2docker</a> on a Windows 10 machine, and you can’t seem to run the intro command <code class=\"language-text\">docker run hello-world</code> as instructed by the installer.</p>\n<p>When you run <code class=\"language-text\">boot2docker init -v</code> you get an error <code class=\"language-text\">Failed to create host-only network interface</code>.</p>\n<p>You have VirtualBox 5.0.x installed and Docker gives you problems like those described above.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>So far there isn’t an official fix, but there is <a href=\"https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/1015#issuecomment-127313908\">test build</a> as described on the boot2docker issue linked above. Personally, I haven’t given it a shot, but it looks like things are on their way to be mended.</p>\n<p>Here’s hoping that it gets fixed so I can finally upgrade my desktop to Windows 10, and get docker running on my laptop.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks for Playing. ~ DW</em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/docker-on-windows-10-problems/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Docker on Windows 10 Problems","tags":["docker","windows 10"],"categories":null,"date":"August 10, 2015","description":null,"excerpt":null,"social_image":null}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Western Devs (and MVP) Found My Spirit Animal"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/western-devs-found-my-spirit-animal/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Running Tomcat Apps on Docker through Eclipse"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/running-tomcat-apps-on-docker-through-eclipse/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/docker-on-windows-10-problems/","prevSlug":"/blog/western-devs-found-my-spirit-animal/","nextSlug":"/blog/running-tomcat-apps-on-docker-through-eclipse/"}},
