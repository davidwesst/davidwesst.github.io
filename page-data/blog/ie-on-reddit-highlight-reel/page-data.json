Sincerely. A lot of things are changing. We announce the end of support for too old versions of IE or for out of date ActiveX control. This is a first step to reduce fragmentation which is really a pain for web developers (Which I’m part of :)) - David</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How do you feel about the fact that most people reading this AMA aren’t using your browser? <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq8nj9\">Link</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Challenged :) - Anton</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>what is the IE team doing about fixing accessibility related bugs? I have filed quite a few, but have not actually seen any implementation changes as yet. some bugs are listed in the implementation testing results i conducted for HTML5 <a href=\"http://stevefaulkner.github.io/html-mapping-tests/\">http://stevefaulkner.github.io/html-mapping-tests/</a> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq8jph\">LINK</a></p>\n<p>and on <a href=\"http://www.html5accessibility.com/\">http://www.html5accessibility.com/</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I may help for this one. Can you send me repro case at [email address removed]? I will add them to our bug tracking system - David</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What’s the biggest issue you’ve ever found in your browser? <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq8n1r\">LINK</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I work on composition and rendering, so my bugs in pre-release builds tend to be pretty severe from a symptom perspective (e.g. “Uhhh… GMail isn’t rendering today, what did you break”).</p>\n<p>We’ll catch super-severe bugs like that before we ship of course :)</p>\n<p>-Matt Rakow</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are there any plans to revamp the extensions stores and the like for IE (to match Firefox/Chrome)?</p>\n<p>Is there an overhaul for the desktop version of the IE UI in the works?</p>\n<p>Will you guys/gals get off the Windows release cycle soon and release monthly updates to IE (more than just bug fixes/security patches but features like Chrome/Firefox)?</p>\n<p>Any chance that IE will become platform agnostic?</p>\n<p>Any chance a uservoice/bug report system for the community will release?</p>\n<p>WebRTC support anytime soon (maybe with Skype support)?</p>\n<p>I’m a big fan of IE but after using it as my daily driver some of the above would make it a lot easier to maintain as my go-to browser. Small bugs here and there can be annoying and having no way to suggest features or report bugs can be annoying. I never know if you guys will work on/fix anything I have on my mind (or other users minds I’m sure). Since you guys seem to be much more open I was hoping this could be a way to get a glimpse of the future. <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq8igv\">LINK</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq9aey\">The full and long response to each and every question</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks for Playing. ~ DW</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/ie-on-reddit-highlight-reel/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"IE on Reddit - Highlight Reel","tags":["ie","internet explorer"],"categories":["technology"],"date":"August 15, 2014","description":null,"excerpt":"To me, this is IamA (I am a something ask me anything) is historic with web platforms.","social_image":{"publicURL":"/static/b2ed2f704df48e447f2a966790f3502f/bvbik2tccaawex1.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b2ed2f704df48e447f2a966790f3502f/a86fd/bvbik2tccaawex1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b2ed2f704df48e447f2a966790f3502f/e869f/bvbik2tccaawex1.jpg 256w,\n/static/b2ed2f704df48e447f2a966790f3502f/a3ca7/bvbik2tccaawex1.jpg 512w,\n/static/b2ed2f704df48e447f2a966790f3502f/a86fd/bvbik2tccaawex1.jpg 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b2ed2f704df48e447f2a966790f3502f/0c128/bvbik2tccaawex1.webp 256w,\n/static/b2ed2f704df48e447f2a966790f3502f/5d10f/bvbik2tccaawex1.webp 512w,\n/static/b2ed2f704df48e447f2a966790f3502f/30a1f/bvbik2tccaawex1.webp 1024w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}]},"width":1024,"height":576}}}}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The MVP Network is Awesome"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/the-mvp-network-is-awesome/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Whatcha doin' DW?"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/whatcha-doin-dw/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/ie-on-reddit-highlight-reel/","prevSlug":"/blog/the-mvp-network-is-awesome/","nextSlug":"/blog/whatcha-doin-dw/"}},
