Sincerely. A lot of things are changing. We announce the end of support for too old versions of IE or for out of date ActiveX control. This is a first step to reduce fragmentation which is really a pain for web developers (Which I’m part of :)) - David</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How do you feel about the fact that most people reading this AMA aren’t using your browser? <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq8nj9\">Link</a>  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Challenged :) - Anton</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>what is the IE team doing about fixing accessibility related bugs? I have filed quite a few, but have not actually seen any implementation changes as yet. some bugs are listed in the implementation testing results i conducted for HTML5 <a href=\"http://stevefaulkner.github.io/html-mapping-tests/\">http://stevefaulkner.github.io/html-mapping-tests/</a> <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq8jph\">LINK</a> </p>\n<p>and on <a href=\"http://www.html5accessibility.com/\">http://www.html5accessibility.com/</a>  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I may help for this one.

Small bugs here and there can be annoying and having no way to suggest features or report bugs can be annoying. I never know if you guys will work on/fix anything I have on my mind (or other users minds I’m sure). Since you guys seem to be much more open I was hoping this could be a way to get a glimpse of the future. <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq8igv\">LINK</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq9aey\">The full and long response to each and every question</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks for Playing. ~ DW</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"IE on Reddit - Highlight Reel","tags":["ie","internet explorer"],"categories":["technology"],"date":"August 15, 2014","description":null,"social_image":{"absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/website/website/content/blog/ie-on-reddit-highlight-reel/bvbik2tccaawex1.jpg"}}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The MVP Network is Awesome"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/the-mvp-network-is-awesome/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Whatcha doin' DW?"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/whatcha-doin-dw/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/ie-on-reddit-highlight-reel/","prevSlug":"/blog/the-mvp-network-is-awesome/","nextSlug":"/blog/whatcha-doin-dw/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2555585279","2841359383","3159585216"]}
