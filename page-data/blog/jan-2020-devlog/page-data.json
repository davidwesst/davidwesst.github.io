Me neither, but this video will fix all that!</p>\n<p>I tend to fall into the crutch of talking about technology rather than actually doing it. There is nothing wrong with the evangelism/marketing side of the tech community, but the whole point of me doing this is to share my journey and the tips along the way. Note the “journey” part means, I have to move the needle. An so, here we are with the first devlog of the year. </p>\n<p>In this video I cover the bit of progres I’ve had on Car Scientist, and how it’s become something of a game development sandbox to practice and (ideally) sharpen my gamedev skills. I also review the LARGE amount of planning I did and reflect a bit on how I sort through what ideas should be in this game versus the next one.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-sKlp_CUhB0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Jan 2020 Devlog","tags":["Devlog","Game Development","Video","Car Scientist"],"categories":["development","projects","video games"],"date":"February 04, 2020","description":"A vlog post where I review the progress I've made on the game Car Scientist.","excerpt":null,"social_image":null}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"How Github Makes Game Making Easier for Noncoders"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/how-github-makes-game-making-easier-for-noncoders/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Where to Find Your Gamedev Community"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/where-to-find-your-gamedev-community/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/jan-2020-devlog/","prevSlug":"/blog/how-github-makes-game-making-easier-for-noncoders/","nextSlug":"/blog/where-to-find-your-gamedev-community/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2555585279","2841359383","3159585216"]}
