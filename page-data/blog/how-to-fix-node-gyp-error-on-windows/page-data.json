This blog post will ensure that not only I remember, but the entire Internet will remember the solution I use.</p>\n<p>Here goes.</p>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<p>The problem is simple: You pull down a repository that uses NPM for package management onto your Windows machine, you type <code class=\"language-text\">npm install</code> and you get something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npm ERR! Failed at the &lt;package>@&lt;version> install script 'node-gyp rebuild'</code></pre></div>\n<p>or</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">gyp ERR! stack Error: Can't find Python executable \"python\", you can set the PYTHON env variable.</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is because the project you’re trying to build requires the <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp\">node-gyp</a> package to build something natively on the platform. That package required Python 2.7 and a few other pieces too.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Simple problems sometimes get simple solutions.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the node-gyp team, that is the case and they have documented it in the project <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp\">README</a>.</p>\n<p>Using a <em>PowerShell</em> CLI instance with administrative priviledges, and use the following code:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> --global --production windows-build-tools</code></pre></div>\n<p>And that’s it.</p>\n<p>There is a manual option as well, but I haven’t needed to use it as the first option always works for me.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/how-to-fix-node-gyp-error-on-windows/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Fix node-gyp Error on Windows","tags":["NodeJS","JavaScript","node-gyp"],"categories":["development"],"date":"September 26, 2016","description":null,"excerpt":"Whenever I get a new machine, I pull down a new project using the `npm install command and get an error related to python and node-gyp.
