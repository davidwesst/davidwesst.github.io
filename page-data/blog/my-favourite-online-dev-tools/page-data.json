So entire development suites like Cloud9 or Visual Studio Online are off the table because they are full tool suites. These tools are simple, but continually help me out in a pinch.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Make sure to share your favourite tools in the comments below so I can learn and grow from your knowledge.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://jsonlint.com\">JSONLint</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/jsonlint.png\" alt=\"http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/jsonlint.png\"></p>\n<p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been writing and debugging a REST API client written in Java, where my POJO is being serialized into JSON and sent off in a request. I hit a few bugs where the JSON that was being generated wasn’t 100% valid. This made validating it easy, and I keep it open whenever I’m dealing with any JSON that isn’t continually being edited in VS Code.</p>\n<p>Also, I missed that there was <a href=\"http://pro.jsonlint.com/\">pro.jsonlint.com</a> which provides a diff function. This would have saved me a ton of time, had I read the description provided on the main page.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.regexr.com/\">Regexr</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/regexr.png\" alt=\"http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/regexr.png\"></p>\n<p>Being a JavaScript person, you’d think I’d be a pro with regular expressions. Thanks to <a href=\"http://regexr.com\">Regexr.com</a> I can at least appear to be. Between the reference guide on the left side, real-time match highlighting, I really like this tool and it has made learning and using regexes in my day-to-day very easy</p>\n<p>Plus, the slick design doesn’t hurt either.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://hex.colorrrs.com/\">Colorrrs</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/colorrrs.png\" alt=\"http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/colorrrs.png\"></p>\n<p>There are other HEX to RGB converters out there, I know. I just really like this one because it gives me a full screen preview of the colour I’m look at, and it’s a pretty website.</p>\n<p>I like pretty websites.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://smartviewapp.com/\">SmartView</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/smartviewapp.png\" alt=\"http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/smartviewapp.png\"></p>\n<p>Now we’re getting into the protein part of our meal.</p>\n<p>I’ve used Trello in the past, and generally end up ditching the project boards because I’m not a Kanban or Agile professional. Lucky for me, my fellow Western Dev <a href=\"http://www.westerndevs.com/bios/amir_barylko/\">Amir Barylko</a> is a professional and has used is expertise to guide me along the path and provides me with some metrics on my throughput.</p>\n<p>They start you off with a free account, which is where I began for a personal kanban for coordinating my side project efforts for myself. I suggest you check it out and get productive.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Full Disclosure</strong>:  As mentioned above, Amir is a colleague of mine and I do support his work. That being said, I wouldn’t have added it to my list if I didn’t use it as much as I do, or if I found it as useful as it really is.</em></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/explore\">GitHub Explore</a> and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/\">GitHub Gists</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/github-gist.png\" alt=\"http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/github-gist.png\"></p>\n<p>Last, but not least, I use <a href=\"https://github.com/explore\">GitHub Explore</a> and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/\">GitHub Gists</a> to explore and find code that can help guide me through solving problems, or by finding open source software and/or libraries that can help solve a problem for me.</p>\n<p>Why re-invent the wheel when someone else has lead a team to and refined a solution to your problem already? At the very least, you can learn from their code and figure out how it applies to you’re trying to do.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks for playing. ~ DW</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/my-favourite-online-dev-tools/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Favourite Online Dev Tools","tags":["cloud ide","cloud9","json","javascript","agile","kanban"],"categories":["development","technology"],"date":"October 28, 2015","description":null,"excerpt":null,"social_image":null}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Inspiration From MVP Summit 2015"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/inspiration-from-mvp-summit-2015/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Using Java Build Script Tasks in Visual Studio Code"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/using-java-build-script-tasks-in-visual-studio-code/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/my-favourite-online-dev-tools/","prevSlug":"/blog/inspiration-from-mvp-summit-2015/","nextSlug":"/blog/using-java-build-script-tasks-in-visual-studio-code/"}},
