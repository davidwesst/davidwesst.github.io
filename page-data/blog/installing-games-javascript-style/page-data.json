Making them playable inside the browser isn’t a short order. Loading all the resources, like graphics, audio, and all that fun, is big.</p>\n<p>When I tried to play FTL in the browser, it took a few hours to load the first time. I mean, it’s downloading the whole thing. The second time around, it up within a few minutes, and I this time I noticed that “This page is requesting more than 50MB of space message” as I didn’t leave it overnight to load.</p>\n<p>Clearly there is room for improvement, but this is still a huge step forward for the way we can distrubute games and other software.</p>\n<h3>The Point</h3>\n<p>This is a real use case of companies taking their non-JavaScript software and making it accessible via the browser. </p>\n<p>Take any LOB application that you want to port forward, and consider that you could make it accessible through a web portal, or inside of SharePoint, or whatever.</p>\n<p>Now, you just worry the the game works in the browser and not the specific platforms.</p>\n<p>Thanks for Playing. ~ DW</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing Games JavaScript Style","tags":["cool-stuff","javascript","games"],"categories":["technology","video games"],"date":"October 24, 2014","description":null,"excerpt":"I bought the Humble Mozilla Bundle earlier this week and I wanted to take a moment to show people what it looks like to install a JavaScript game in the browser.","social_image":null}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Why the Humble Mozilla Bundle is Awesome"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/why-the-humble-mozilla-bundle-is-awesome/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Humble Bundle Games Go JavaScript"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/humble-bundle-games-go-javascript/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/installing-games-javascript-style/","prevSlug":"/blog/why-the-humble-mozilla-bundle-is-awesome/","nextSlug":"/blog/humble-bundle-games-go-javascript/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2555585279","2841359383","3159585216"]}
