Get to the Point is <a href=\"http://youtu.be/M5OQchl9bQA\">the first video</a> of a series of short videos I plan on talking about code, video games, and hybrid topics in between.</p>\n<p>It’s something I’ve wanted to do for quite some time now, and here’s hoping I keep it up in 2015.</p>\n<h3>Viva la Blog</h3>\n<p>If you’re reading this, then you might have noticed I’ve been blogging pretty regularily for the past few months. Not just here, but I had a <a href=\"http://d.wes.st/1yroBzI\">whole series on getting Ghost on Azure</a>, complete with a custom theme and SSL on the Canadian Developer Connection.</p>\n<p>The blog really was a great outlet for me to help me figure out what I wanted to do with my professional side, or whatever you want to call what I do.</p>\n<p>The plan is to keep that up. It’s a good way for me to play around with ideas and content and share ‘em with you fine people.</p>\n<h3>Back into the Speaker Spotlight</h3>\n<p>{% asset_img imaginet-html5event_small.jpg %}</p>\n<p>That’s an old picture of me, but you can imagine that my reintroduction into public speaking looked that awesome.</p>\n<p>I took over a year off of public speaking, but broke the silence with a Winnipeg .NET User Group presentation I call Going Terminal: Learning to be IDE Free.</p>\n<p>In 2015, I’ll be heading to <a href=\"http://www.prairiedevcon.com/\">Prairie Dev Con</a>, here in Winnipeg, to present on a new dev story where we go from Web to Mobile App using Cordova.</p>\n<h3>Actually Finishing Up Projects</h3>\n<p><img src=\"newzvgqtitle.PNG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Given I consider my blog and website far from complete, I have made some serious strides in focusing the time I have to code projects and have actually seen progress.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/zvgq/zvgq\">biggest project</a> has been the “New” Zany Video Game Quotes website. Something I’ve been slowly working on with one of my closest friends for years. It’s only now, nearly 5 years later, that I have something to show.</p>\n<p>I didn’t quite get everything I wanted done for January 1, but I made some serious progress and have something to show for it.</p>\n<p>Expect more details on what I’ve learned and have planned for that project in 2015.</p>\n<h3>Embracing my Passion of Video Games</h3>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 230px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/1dafcfc1d8d13c6fb13e8820f3faab47/81c8e/html5-controller.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75.9493670886076%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"html5 controller\"\n        title=\"html5 controller\"\n        src=\"/static/1dafcfc1d8d13c6fb13e8820f3faab47/81c8e/html5-controller.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/1dafcfc1d8d13c6fb13e8820f3faab47/c26ae/html5-controller.png 158w,\n/static/1dafcfc1d8d13c6fb13e8820f3faab47/81c8e/html5-controller.png 230w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>I have forever been trying to figure out a way to balance my love for gaming with my love for code.</p>\n<p>Between my Twitch stream, and constant watching of YouTubers, I’ve decided it makes more sense to just embrace my love for both and work through finding the balance.</p>\n<p>I’m not sure where it will go in 2015, but I have some ideas.
