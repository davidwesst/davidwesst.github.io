It’s called Awesome Games Done Quickly, or AGDQ.</p>\n<p>It’s a fund raising marathon, where for an entire week a group of gamers, known as speed runners, play a series of video games as fast as humanly possible. Sometimes is just someone on their own, sometimes it’s a race, or sometimes, it’s a blindfold challenge (i.e. the person plays the game blindfolded).</p>\n<p>Throughout the marathon they accept donations that go towards a charity. This year, they chose the Prevent Cancer Foundation, and 100% of the donations go towards the charity. There isn’t anything cut off for administration fees or anything.</p>\n<p>{% asset_img AGDQ-miketyson.png “Video Games Preventing Cancer with AGDQ” %}</p>\n<p>As of this writing, they have collected over $530K in donations from people <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick\">watching on Twitch</a>.</p>\n<p>Plus, that doesn’t ever include <a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/\">the Humble Bundle package</a> that people can buy and donate other ways.</p>\n<h2>Huh?</h2>\n<p>Don’t ask questions. It’s an amazing event and I am just blown away by the generosity of the gamer community along with insane skill demonstrated on these games. I mean, beating Mike Tyson’s Punch out in 22 minutes?</p>\n<p>Complete insanity. I have yet to even get to Mike Tyson on my own.</p>\n<h2>The Point</h2>\n<p>I just wanted to share this as I find it cool and video games are a real passion of mine. I suggest you <a href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick\">check it out on Twitch</a>, or even <a href=\"https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/donate/12\">donate</a> if you’re so inclined.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing. ~ DW</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/video-games-preventing-cancer-with-agdq/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Video Games Preventing Cancer with AGDQ","tags":["games"],"categories":["video games","inner monologue"],"date":"January 08, 2015","description":null,"excerpt":"I wanted to share something I find freaking cool.
