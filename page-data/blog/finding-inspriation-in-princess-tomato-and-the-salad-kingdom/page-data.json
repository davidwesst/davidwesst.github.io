I was surprised too, but it’s been a game I’ve wanted to really play for a long time and it just jumped out at my browsing through the boxes and carts.</p>\n<h2>What do you know about the game?</h2>\n<p>Not much really.</p>\n<p>I bought it as a gift to my better half on eBay because she’s vegetarian and thought it would be amusing.</p>\n<p>It was an high cost dad joke (even though I wasn’t a dad at the time), and have no regrets.</p>\n<p>Outside of the weirdness that are sentient vegetables, I know it’s a classic PC game port and text adventure. Gameplay seems light, but I always had a thing for these kinds of text adventures on the NES (I.E. <a href=\"https://www.igdb.com/games/deja-vu-a-nightmare-comes-true--1\">Déjà Vu</a>, from Kemco/ICOM Simulations) and want to see what, if anything, makes this one special.</p>\n<p>If I remember correctly, there is a battle system in the game, but it’s very simple. As many older Japanese titles use, this game uses a Roshambo or Rock, Paper, Scissors sort of random battle. I’m hoping this doesn’t limit my progress to the RNG gods, but I suppose I’ll find out. </p>\n<h1>What are you hoping for?</h1>\n<p>I’m hoping for something more than a visual novel and some different sorts of interactivity with the characters in the world. </p>\n<p>My guess is that it’s a “room based” navigation system, but I’m curious about the adventure and RPG elements in it, if any.</p>\n<p>With respect to inspiration, I am hoping to find a new or different to engage with a text driven game. </p>\n<h1>TL;DR; / Conclusion</h1>\n<p>My expectations aren’t too high for this game, but I am hoping to find inspiration in the way a text-driven game engages with players. </p>\n<p>Stream starts tonight, July 20th at 9pm (UTC-5), on <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/davidwesst\">Twitch</a>.</p>\n<p>This is the first one, so here’s hoping the tech forces of the universe are with me. </p>\n<p>Thanks for playing (and watching). </p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/finding-inspriation-in-princess-tomato-and-the-salad-kingdom/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"","tags":null,"categories":null,"date":null,"description":null,"excerpt":"In search for inspiration in my own game collection I've decided to explore this text-based salad adventure.","social_image":null}},"prev":null,"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"YouTube and Twitch: My Revengence"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/youtube-and-twitch-my-revengence/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/finding-inspriation-in-princess-tomato-and-the-salad-kingdom/","prevSlug":null,"nextSlug":"/blog/youtube-and-twitch-my-revengence/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2555585279","2841359383","3159585216"]}
