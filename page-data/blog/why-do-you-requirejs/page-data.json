(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMpXAknykeg\">Sad Trombone</a>)</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"requirejs-logo.PNG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Here’s why I use <a href=\"http://requirejs.org/\">RequireJS</a>: it ensures that the JavaScript I need to run my code is loaded. I don’t need to worry about the order of the <code class=\"language-text\">&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;</code> tags in the HTML. I don’t need to do any sort of checking or <code class=\"language-text\">onload</code> event stuff, I just know it’s good to go.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jsbin.com/OfIBAxA/10/embed?js,console,output\">See demo at JSBin</a><script src=\"http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js\"></script></p>\n<p>Second reason: It defines a single point to start the application with the definition of the <code class=\"language-text\">data-main</code> JavaScipt file. So, when I load an HTML page, I know the first line of JavaScript that will be executed and can build from there. Again, not worrying about multiple files loading at the same time and executing in parallel or anything.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;\r\n    &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;\r\n    &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;\r\n    &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;\r\n        &amp;lt;script data-main=\"path/to/main\" src=\"path/to/require.js\"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;\r\n    &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;\r\n`&lt;/pre>\r\n\r\nThe `path/to/main` is a reference to a main.js file. RequireJS doesn't need the JS, as it's implied.\r\n\r\nPlus, because of the whole \"knowing that my JavaScript is already loaded\", I know that the libraries that I leverage (e.g. jQuery, Bootstrap, whatever...) will already be loaded and setup before I start running my application code.\r\n\r\n#### Ha! What about your library dependencies?\r\n\r\nI define and configure those in the RequireJS config JSON that gets run before we start the application.\r\n\r\n&lt;pre>`require.config\r\n    paths:\r\n        # dummy path for demo\r\n        'jquery': 'http://davidwesst.com' \r\n    shim:\r\n        # This is a sample of defining dependencies\r\n        \"bootstrap\":\r\n            deps: \"jquery\"\r\n            exports: \"Bootstrap\"</code></pre></div>\n<h4>Double “Ha”! What about your text file dependencies?</h4>\n<p>I don’t usually need it, but if I do there is <a href=\"http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text\">a plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>Plus, if you’re using text files to localize your site, there is <a href=\"http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#i18n\">another plugin</a> to help that that too.</p>\n<h3>The Point</h3>\n<p>When I start a project, I make sure I wire up RequireJS first before I start writing any code. Because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don’t need to worry about libraries and other script not being loaded</li>\n<li>I know where my application will start every time the page loads</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, it gives me less things that could go wrong while I’m focusing on writing code. Plus, as a keep building the application, it forces me to think about what my “new” code needs to depend on as I go making it cleaner and easier for someone to get into.</p>\n<p>Learn about it here. Given, it’s a steep learning curve with that documentation, but I guarantee it’s worth it.</p>\n<p>Thanks for Playing. ~ DW</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/why-do-you-requirejs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why do you RequireJS?","tags":["code","requirejs"],"categories":["development"],"date":"October 07, 2014","description":null,"excerpt":"Get it?
