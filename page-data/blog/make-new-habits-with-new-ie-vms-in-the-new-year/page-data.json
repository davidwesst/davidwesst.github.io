Well, I’ll give you one: Test your application in IE.</p>\n<p>And what do you know, the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2015/01/06/ie-test-vms-on-modern-ie-get-a-refresh.aspx\">IE team has updated all their <strong>free</strong> VMs</a> at <a href=\"https://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools\">modern.ie</a> just in time for you to start testing.</p>\n<h2>Isn’t Spartan Replacing IE?</h2>\n<p>Who knows. Maybe they are, maybe they aren’t. The important thing to note though that whatever fate IE has, it’s not just going to disappear overnight.</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"http://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=0&#x26;qpcustomd=0\">NetMarketShare</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"netmarketshare_dec.PNG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>As you can see, IE8+ has quite the presence. Sure, you can argue and throw <a href=\"http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportClients.htm\">other</a> <a href=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201411-201412\">stats</a> <a href=\"http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php?year=2014&#x26;month=12\">sites</a> back at me, but all of the major players say IE represents a big chunk of the internet.</p>\n<p>Spartan or no Spartan, IE has a presence that will stick around one way or another. So you should probably test it to make sure it works.</p>\n<h3>Couple of Improvements</h3>\n<p>With the new VMs out, there have been a few changes for the good. More specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They use ZIP files rather than RAR</li>\n<li>New download options (single download or multiple)</li>\n<li>Upgrades to new versions of IE are turned off by default</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Plus, all the OS updates through until November are installed, so you’ll pretty much good to go as soon as they are downloaded.</p>\n<h2>The Point</h2>\n<p>There are new VMs out and this is your chance to start testing your application properly, which needs to include IE whether or like it or not.</p>\n<p>Thanks for Playing. ~ DW</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/make-new-habits-with-new-ie-vms-in-the-new-year/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Make New Habits with New IE VMs in the New Year","tags":["Spartan","Testing"],"categories":["technology"],"date":"January 07, 2015","description":null,"excerpt":"Happy New Year!
