The error looks something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Error: Cannot find module ‘/some/path/with/ahashvalue/vscode-js-debug-bootloader.js’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It happened to me <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1241089586\">on stream the other day</a> and thought I’d take a moment to document the fix.</p>\n<p>After some searching, this <a href=\"200~https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/issues/374\">GitHub Issue</a> comes up with the <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/issues/374#issuecomment-622239998\">the following</a> answer to resolve it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because this is happening in tasks, I think you’re running into microsoft/vscode#96375. You should be able to fix this by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Setting debug.node.autoAttach to “disabled” (to clear previous bad state)</li>\n<li>Setting it back to on or off, as you prefer</li>\n<li>Using thewarning icon on the top right to relaunch terminals as desired (or just reopen/reload VS Code)</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Follow the steps in the VSCode settings for the DevContainer (i.e. workspaace) and it works. Here’s an example of me doing it on stream. <strong>Note:</strong> The fix happens right away, but it takes a minute for me to test and confirm it.</p>\n<div id=\"twitch-embed\"></div>\n<script src=\"https://player.twitch.tv/js/embed/v1.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  new Twitch.Player(\"twitch-embed\", {\n    video: \"1241089585\"\n  });\n</script>\n<p>Here’s hoping this helps someone else out there looking for this solution.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing.</p>\n<p>~ DW</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/missing-bootloader-in-vscode-devcontainer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cannot Find Module Bootloader.js in VSCode DevContainer","tags":["devcontainer","nodejs","vscode"],"categories":["code"],"date":"November 17, 2022","description":"Problem: When running node commands from within a DevContainer, you receive the error 'Cannot find module bootloader.js'.
