If you’re looking for technical content, this isn’t the post for you,</em></p>\n<h3>Hypertext Gaming and Twitch</h3>\n<p><img src=\"GlitchIcon_purple-128x128.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://http://www.davidwesst.com/hypertext-gaming-starting-june-29/\">original plan</a> for this was to focus all of my streaming on HTML5 related content. I planned it all out, and with doing three streams per week, for about 2 hours each stream, lead to a realization: I need a lot of content to fill that time.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it needed to change, and it has. Now I just do games that I want to do and “analyze” them in an attempt to eventually try and create my own game.</p>\n<p>Details of when/why/how of the game are still unknown. But, it’s refreshing to do something that is close to my heart and really a departure from what I’m used to sharing on the web.</p>\n<p>If you feel like joining the conversation, head over on Sunday, Monday, or Thursday at 9pm CT to chat games, HTML5, or whatever is on your mind.</p>\n<h4>Hypertext Gaming…is it still a thing?</h4>\n<p>Yup.</p>\n<p>Doing the Twitch stream has lead me down a path of learning how to do video content, and think down that line. For a long time, I’ve had content planned out for video casting, but wasn’t familiar with the tools.</p>\n<p>Doing a livestream changes that, and I’m hoping to have some content (including HypertextGaming as a show) soon.</p>\n<h3>Codin’ Stuff and Projects</h3>\n<p>Over the past year, I’ve pretty much reinvented myself as a developer by learning how to work without an IDE and using nothing more than a terminal and some kind of text editor.</p>\n<p>It’s been a success, and at this point I use a browser-based IDE to code sometimes, or VI, Notepad++, or gedit. I’ve even moved onto a Linux box to do web development and deploy it to the Azure cloud. Kinda cool, if you ask me (but I’m biased).</p>\n<p>Check out my progress on <a href=\"http://github.com/davidwesst\">Github</a> to see my commits. You can expect a series of developer videos on this in the coming months, as I’ve been planning it for a while.</p>\n<p>We’ll see how it goes, now that the blog is upgraded and setup with all the bells and whistles I wanted.</p>\n<h3>Blog/Vlog - Make Some Content</h3>\n<p>For the longest time I’ve wanted to vlog alongside my text-based blog, but have held off. With the Twitch stuff, I have the equipment to record things at the level of quality I want, and it has allowed me to work on my video conversation skills.</p>\n<p>We’ll see where this goes, but I see this being the first set of video content I start posting on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Oh, you’ve probably noticed some changes to the site. It’s going to do that as this is one of the projects I’ve been tinkering with that is going to turn into a video series if I manage to pull it together.</p>\n<p>Feel free to add comment to the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Okay, that’s enough of a personal update. I’ll be in touch soon, I’m sure.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing.</p>\n<p>~ DW</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/whatcha-doin-dw/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Whatcha doin' DW?","tags":["twitch","html5"],"categories":["projects"],"date":"July 29, 2014","description":null,"excerpt":"Lot's of stuff really, but here's the big ones at 50,000 feet.","social_image":null}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"IE on Reddit - Highlight Reel"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/ie-on-reddit-highlight-reel/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Hypertext Gaming - Starting June 29th on Twitch"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/hypertext-gaming-starting-june-29th-on-twitch/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/whatcha-doin-dw/","prevSlug":"/blog/ie-on-reddit-highlight-reel/","nextSlug":"/blog/hypertext-gaming-starting-june-29th-on-twitch/"}},
