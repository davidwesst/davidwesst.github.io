It’s called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLx053rWZxCiYWsBETgdKrQ\">Lazy Game Reviews</a>, and last night I came across a great playlist of only four episoded called: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB1vrRFJI1Q&#x26;list=PLbBZM9aUMsjEVZPCDMl-lXOx50rSBNFQC\">LGR Tech Tales</a> where LGR, the host, goes through a specific event in computer history.</p>\n<p>{% youtube wQdK9owqVd0 %}</p>\n<h2>What’s so Interesting?</h2>\n<p>Outside of reviewing old <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecxADZwybfE&#x26;index=3&#x26;list=PLFDCFCDFCF7E7ACDD\">PC hardware</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64_CJWYlJho&#x26;list=PLbBZM9aUMsjF6-OXZikdTZL9F5OiYsXW0\">MS-DOS games</a> elsewhere on the channel, this series struck a cord with me because it talks about the beginnings of Traf-O-Data, which we now know as Microsoft.</p>\n<p>What I find so facinating, are the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hJNaAG2BXow?list=PLbBZM9aUMsjEVZPCDMl-lXOx50rSBNFQC\">Digital Research</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wQdK9owqVd0?list=PLbBZM9aUMsjEVZPCDMl-lXOx50rSBNFQC\">IBM OS/2</a> stories and how they relate to Microsoft. More specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When looking for a custom OS for their new PC, Microsoft forwarded IBM to Digital Research. It wasn’t until later that Microsoft bought a product and marketed it as MS-DOS 1.0 and took on the contract from IBM, due to frustrations with Digital Research</li>\n<li>After commissioning a custom OS from Microsoft, eventually IBM gave up the contract and went to develop their own OS. That original OS, formely named PC-DOS, became Windows NT, the OS we all know and love today.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Point</h2>\n<p>I’ve just really found LGR interesting. Looking back at computing history through the 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s shows just how different things have become.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I have no point other than old computers are really cool. If you’re interested in that kind of thing, then I suggest you check out LGR on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Thanks for Playing.</p>\n<p>~ DW</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/a-lesson-in-humility/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Traf-O-Data and Windows NT on LGR Tech Tales","tags":["fun","YouTube","Microsoft"],"categories":null,"date":"April 08, 2015","description":null,"excerpt":"In recent days, a specific YouTube channel has my caught my attention.
