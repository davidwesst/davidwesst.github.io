The hard part isn’t getting it run on the platform, but ensure that your user’s platform can run your code.</p>\n<p>Unless you’re some kind of name, or have a large scale brand or buzz or investment backing your idea, you likely aren’t going to sway your user away from their device(s) of choice.</p>\n<p>So, I ask once again: why would you limit yourself from day one?</p>\n<h3>The Point</h3>\n<p>I realize there are a lot of things I’m not covering here; such as the fact that native apps have richer functionality when written in their native programming language.</p>\n<p>That is totally true. </p>\n<p>But, if you don’t have a specific reason for sticking to a single platform, why would you limit your code base right from the start? Especially, when the native language of that whole “Internet” is JavaScript?</p>\n<p>In any case, that is why I JavaScript and why I think you should JavaScript too.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing. ~ DW</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why do I JavaScript?","tags":["code","javascript"],"categories":["development"],"date":"September 25, 2014","description":null,"excerpt":"The answer is simple: I don't want to limit about my platform options on day one.","social_image":null}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Why do you CoffeeScript your JavaScript?"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/why-do-you-coffeescript-your-javascript/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The MVP Network is Awesome"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/the-mvp-network-is-awesome/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/why-do-i-javascript/","prevSlug":"/blog/why-do-you-coffeescript-your-javascript/","nextSlug":"/blog/the-mvp-network-is-awesome/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2555585279","2841359383","3159585216"]}
