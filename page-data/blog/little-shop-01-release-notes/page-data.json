There are still plenty of bugs (as the video even showed) but it works and playable.</p>\n<p>Second, this release is the original vision of what I pictured the gamejam submission to be when D’Arcy and I came up with the idea back in April. Many months later, I have that release which says a lot about my prototyping and experimenting process (i.e. I’m too slow).</p>\n<p>Lastly, I have multiple versions of the game out there including Linux/X11 and Windows versions. There’s still a lot more to learn and do with the while devops setup for my projects, but this is a great step forward and can be reused with all my Godot-based projects moving forward.</p>\n<p>Until the next one— thanks for playing.</p>\n<p>~ DW</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/little-shop-01-release-notes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Release Notes for Little Shop of Wall Street 0.1.0-beta","tags":["gamedev","game development","devlog","little shop of wall street","godot"],"categories":["development","projects","video games"],"date":"July 02, 2020","description":"Little Shop of Wall Street has a 0.1-beta release!","excerpt":null,"social_image":null}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Game Portfolio Self Evaluation (in prep for Ludum Dare 47)"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/game-portfolio-evaluation-2020/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"I Miss Blogging"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/i-miss-blogging/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/little-shop-01-release-notes/","prevSlug":"/blog/game-portfolio-evaluation-2020/","nextSlug":"/blog/i-miss-blogging/"}},
