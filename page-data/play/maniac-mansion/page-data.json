Can use common commands with select button, but clearly a PC port.","Puzzles":"4","Puzzles_Comment":"Enjoyable, even with the occasional moon logic puzzle. Would probably be lower if I didn't already have a familiarity with the game.","Co_op_Style":"Collaborative","Co_op_Comment":"Any idea is plausible and having extra another perspective can unlock new endings, content, or areas. This actually happened on stream by finding a new \"death\" ending with the green tentacle.","The_Fun":"The combination of humour, mystery, and exploration. Especially the exploration factor, as there are a lot of rooms to explore in the game, each with its own set of secrets.","The_Less_Fun":"Moon logic puzzles. Sometimes the threads to lead you to a solution are very thin or not obvious at all.","The_Hook":"The humour and weirdness definitely make you want to stay. They bring you in with little vignettes or cut-scenes to introduce you to the weirdness the family in the mansion causes and lives with.","TLDR":"","Time_Played":"","Story":"3","Story_Comment":"It's a silly story and for the time, it does well. A lot of jokes, and they bring the player along for the ride by breaking the fourth wall once and a while. Really appreicate Ron Gilbert's early work."}},"pageContext":{"slug":"maniac-mansion","title":"Maniac Mansion"}},
