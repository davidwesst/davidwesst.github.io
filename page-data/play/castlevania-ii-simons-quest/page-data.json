Leads to items, and more importantly, hint books. Not a fan, but good with an FAQ.","Controls":"4","Controls_Comment":"Feels like Castlevania for the NES with RPG mechanics.","Puzzles":"2","Puzzles_Comment":"The puzzles are really just item puzzles obscured through a lack of hints and secret block hunting","Co_op_Style":"None","Co_op_Comment":"This is a single player experience. Might help with someone on the couch with an FAQ, but not really necessary to enjoy it more.","The_Fun":"Exploring the world, finding the towns, and trying to learn everything you can. The controls feel great and once you get the hang of it, it's a cool way to explore the game world.","The_Less_Fun":"Secret blocks and invisible blocks (i.e. they look like they are there, but they aren't). Spamming holy water is not fun.","The_Hook":"The controls combined with the mystery of exploring the world. Upgrading your character also feels pretty good, especially in the early part of the game.","TLDR":"","Time_Played":"","Story":"1","Story_Comment":"They really didnt' care much for the story, considering that the NPCs don't really know what's going on other than how to provide you some tips and tricks to advance the game. Not the worst I've seen, but definitely less good."}},"pageContext":{"slug":"castlevania-ii-simons-quest","title":"Castlevania II: Simon's Quest"}},
