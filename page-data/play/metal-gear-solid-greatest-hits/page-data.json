Played with a DualShock 2 with rumble, but can imagine it would have been harder with just the d-pad.","Puzzles":"3","Puzzles_Comment":"It's stealth, which is fine, just not my favourite.","Co_op_Style":"Couch","Co_op_Comment":"I think someone backseatting would enjoy this because it's pretty much like a movie, and I could probably use the help on parts that are \"easy\".","The_Fun":"The story and the flavour around the story. Between the different characters you can call on the radio, you get different ideas from different people on what's going on. Considering it's a solo stealth game, its really impressive they manage this B-rate story with so many different characters through just the codec screen.","The_Less_Fun":"The sneakiness and the need to practice with the controls. That's probably more of a \"me\" problem, but it's definitely less fun for me for that reason. I like feeling in control in the first 15 minutes or so.","The_Hook":"That flavour (see the fun) really keeps me wanting to meet new characters and figure out what is going on. In the first two hours, it kept the story beats flowing","TLDR":"","Time_Played":"","Story":"3","Story_Comment":"Just like the NES game, this story is bananas, but works well with the gameplay. Things like Psycho Mantis, and just player interferance with the story delivery is always great."}},"pageContext":{"slug":"metal-gear-solid-greatest-hits","title":"Metal Gear Solid (Greatest Hits)"}},
