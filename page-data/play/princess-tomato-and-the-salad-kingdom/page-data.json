Expected to trial and error yourself into soft locks and solutions by restarting the level using the password system.","Controls":"4","Controls_Comment":"Number of action buttons, but purely text driven.","Puzzles":"2","Puzzles_Comment":"Puzzles sometime require repeated action taken on a single item until the 3rd or 4th attempt gives you a different response.","Co_op_Style":"None","Co_op_Comment":"Because of the repeated action requirement on the puzzles, the collaboration would be less interesting and more of a \"try this boring thing\"","The_Fun":"Exploration of a weird world where all the graphics have a text-based description","The_Less_Fun":"Soft locking yourself in a level and needing to restart.","The_Hook":"Weird world and cheezy dialogue and story kept me there. It especially worked in the first level, but didn't last for the second level once I soft locked myself in a few different ways.","TLDR":"Test","Time_Played":"","Story":"2","Story_Comment":"The story was there, but there really wasn't a lot of depth. This should probably have been expected, but I appreciated the attempt at trying to tell an interesting and somewhat dramatic damsel in distress story."}},"pageContext":{"slug":"princess-tomato-and-the-salad-kingdom","title":"Princess Tomato and the Salad Kingdom"}},
