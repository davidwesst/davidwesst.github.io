Websites are sooooooo…2006. With social media dominating the way people consume content these days, what is the point of having a website today? I asked myself this question as I put the effort into reviving my dead website and I stand by the idea that having a website for yourself, project, or business is still relevant and necessary in the age of social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;You Own Your Website&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most important reason to have a website. You can &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; it. You get to make all the decisions about it, decide what content goes up, what comes down, what it looks like, all of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content ownership is the big reason why I revived my own blog and website, because I wanted to own the content itself. Posting on a shared site, or massive platforms like Medium or YouTube, you don’t own the platform or the direction of the platform. You are beholdant to the platform changes or mergers or whatever other sweeping change they make. When you own your site, you own the direction, and (assuming you keep backups) the whole content set is in your hands at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Platform Independence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With social platforms, if they change so do you. If they go down, so do you. If they rebrand or merge with another platform, so do you (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web, as a platform, is an open one that nobody owns. It’s portable and accessible with some basic development skills that can be acquired pretty easily and for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked about the open web in my previous life (and posts) enough, but web technology is open, standards-driven, and can do almost anything you can think of (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mixedreality.mozilla.org/hello-webxr/&quot;&gt;WebXR anyone?&lt;/a&gt;). The more work you put in, the more tailored your experience can be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hold Up! Social Platforms are free, web hosting co…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m just going to stop you right there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pay for my domain and the tooling for my website, but I don’t pay for the hosting. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; does the hosting and they do it for free. Given, I don’t pull a ton of traffic and I’m sure I’d have to pay if my traffic were much higher. But that’s a good problem to have to solve, and it’s easily solved by turning your website into a business…so yeah. You’re good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Website is your Universal Digital Home Base&lt;/h1&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media platforms are walled gardens or trash fires (depending on how you look at it). The keyword there is “walled”, such that a person trying to view your content has to climb to see it. Usually that wall is having an account, which doesn’t seem like a big ask, but &lt;em&gt;why should they have to do anything&lt;/em&gt; to read what you’re sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about that experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jane learns about this awesome blog written by David Wesst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;[USER ACTION]&lt;/em&gt; Jane searches for “David Wesst Awesome Blog” on their favourite search engine, Bing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;[USER ACTION]&lt;/em&gt; Jane clicks on the link presented to them to view the awesome blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;[USER ACTION]&lt;/em&gt; Jane is prompted to login to Facebook to view the blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jane is annoyed because they haven’t logged into Facebook in 4 years and doesn’t want to start today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jane moves onto the next thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a search and click to view the blog, it’s a search, click, and login. And what for? So Facebook (or whatever flavour of social media host) can learn more about Jane? Is your content that good? If it is, why does Facebook get to gatekeep and set requirements on people that view your content?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why a website wins, it’s universal. You can even shave it down to one USER ACTION if Jane knows the URL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hold Up! You can adjust the settings on &lt;SOCIAL PLATFORM&gt; so it’s viewable from the public web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, but there are still gates to jump through if you want to explore the content further (which you probably do).  Plus, the experience is filled with “JOIN US!” prompts along the way. What value does the user get out trying to get the user to login or create an account? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that to say, social platforms make hurdle for your users, but that’s not to say you can’t get any value out of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Websites Compliment Social Platforms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a website is your home base, then social platforms are the roads leading there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t find a social platform that doesn’t ask for a URL for your profile. This means that assuming you have a website, regardless of where someone hears about you, they will all land in the same place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but people can verify themselves that your Twitter account and Facebook Page are for the same thing! It’s a luxury to have the same username across all the social media platforms, and a website can help you link your social media presence together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even goes the other way, where someone who finds you on Facebook, heads to your website, and then learns that you have a Twitter account (or whatever) under a slightly different URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the heading says, they compliment one and another quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Largest Audience is the Whole Internet&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my last reason, and it’s relevant. If you’re talking about size, the internet is bigger than a subset of the internet. It is the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media platforms are communities where companies try to get you to hang out in &lt;em&gt;their part&lt;/em&gt; of the internet. Some of the internet is not the whole internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hold Up! The Social Networks Make My Content More Discoverable.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They very much do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, see my above point about how websites &lt;em&gt;compliment&lt;/em&gt; social platforms. Maybe they never leave the social network to consume your content because you crosspost, the point is that they can and the original source for the content is owned by you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion / TL;DR;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website is important because it acts as a hub to send people, regardless of what platform they learn or hear about your idea. It’s like a business card or phone number, where you can leave it anyone to consume. Even in the cases where you don’t get to leave it, people can search you out via their search engine of choice if you get it setup. A website also compliments your social media presence, such that social media is the plumbing that leads people to your website where they can learn all about your idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a win-win, even if it’s not what everyone is talking about when it comes how people “use the web” in 202x.&lt;/p&gt;

More specifically Twitter and YouTube, but Facebook and Instagram as well. That single month has turned into just over three months now, and I learned a few things about myself and how I think my return to &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; social media will be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Where it started…&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a millennial. Which means, I’ve been doing social media since before it was called “social media”. I got onto Twitter very early on, I needed a university email address to create my Facebook account, and YouTube…well, it wasn’t owned by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point being is that social media has been a part of my entire adult life. I actually can’t rememberof a time in my professional life that someone wasn’t telling me that my social media presence or “brand” had the ability to propel my career forward, if I played my tweets just right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is probably that every job I had in tech was surrounded by marketing people, but I developed this bizarre obsession over “my brand” or “persona” that I portrayed to the online world. For years I have gone through exercises about how to build followers, read the analytics, all on a mission to appear professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a fruitless venture. I’m pretty sure my blog and Twitter account secured my many MVP awards. What I wasn’t expecting was the dependency this obsession created, which was this weird addiction to “likes”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;“Likes” = Validation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the MVP program was how I validated doing all the extra work on keeping up with technology. I love tech, I really really do, but had someone not pointed me in the direction of building a brand around JavaScript and/or Front-End Web Dev, I probably never would have gone down that road. As I built up that persona, th more likes and engagement I got, and the more likely the MVP Program would notice me. Eventually they did notice me and &lt;em&gt;TA-DA&lt;/em&gt;, I became a Microsoft MVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MVP Award was where I think this all started. It was a reward for being so…professional or knowledgable or hard-working in my B-time or whatever. I loved it and somehow rationalized that people get directly rewarded for their side efforts. I suppose that is sort of true, depending on how to define the term “reward”, but in general I don’t think it’s as big of a perk as the MVP Award and all the benefits that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the years went by, I started to expect that sort of reward for my effort and equated with validation and started to &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; it in order feel like I was succeeding as a technology professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I decided to let go of the MVP Award and chase my dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Validation Withdrawl&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part in the story where I started chase my game development hopes and dreams. It started out well, but not long after doing some game development streams on Mixer (yeah, remember Mixer?) and some blog posts, I started to feel uneasy about my ability and my “success” as a technology professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building an expertise takes time and effort. It takes even more time and effort when you day job doesn’t care or need that expertise, and you have a new family to take care of. I kept getting caught up on how long it would take for me to “become a professional” or whatever. I kept checking my different social media analytics and started focusing a lot of time and energy on making game development content rather than actual games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I resarched marketing techniques, read social media management guides, and started learning how to promote my “dream game” before I had even really done anything other than a couple of game jams. I checked the “likes” multiple times a day and tried to figure out how to maximize the reach of my content, continuing to get in the way of building an actual commercial video game, but searching (somewhat desperately) for that acknowledgement through likes, thumbs up, post engagement, and views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It kept coming and going, but it would always block my progress on whatever project I was working on. My game jams were about the content I produced, not the game itself. After a jam, I would share and talk about “the next steps” and all the planning I was doing instead of &lt;em&gt;actually doing&lt;/em&gt; something with the project. No matter how much time I spent, there wasn’t enough to both “share to the community” and build a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an old habit that needed to go away, and so earlier this year I just stopped sharing on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That break was supposed last about month. That was about three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Realization and Return&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my three month break, I looked inward and thought about what I’ve done with social media over…well, most of my professional life. I’ve decided that it’s time to start figuring out how or if I should return to the social networks, but I’m taking it slow and flipping the script on my social media shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than measuring my successwith likes and views, I’m looking at the social platforms as ways for me to grow personally and professionally. I’m asking myself two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does my contribution do for the reader/viewer/you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does my contribution do for me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does v7 of my website coincide with this? It sure does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll elaborate further another day, but just writing this post helps me reflect on my own story. It feels honest and healthy to write all this down and I’m creating content for both  &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; and the readers. I share not only because I crave validation, but also think that my sharing my experience might help others learn something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is site and blog is the start. It has a purpose for both my personal and professional growth and so it is alive again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aren’t you just going to obsess over the analytics again?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think so. I have analytics enabled on the site, but I have purpose for this: to learn. More specifically, I want to learn about what analytics can teach me about my audience. It’s not just about views and the likes, a but what the readers (and players) are telling me through their engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus— whether I like it or not, analytics plays a critical role in decision making these days. I see it in my day job, and I see it in game development. Either way, it’s probably having some literacy around the different kinds of analytics out there can’t hurt me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is not wrapping success around the metrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s going to be YouTube and other video content like livestreams. I really enjoy making my little movies, and with the pandemic in full swing, it’s hampered my ability to practice my presentation skills at conferences with an audience. Between platforms like YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitch , and even Discord, there are some good opportunities to sharpen my video presentation skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m being honest, I can’t see Twitter or Facebook making a comeback in my day-to-day life. Possibly a place to echo posts or share activity, but I’m just not feeling the “hot takes” nature that comes with Twitter and Facebook. As for Instagram…I’m still undecided. I don’t have a lot of pictures to share behind the scenes, but again— never say never. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where I share content, the website will be hub and the question will the same: What does sharing do to help me grow personally and/or professionally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing. ~ DW&lt;/p&gt;

I’m calling this v7, although I’m pretty sure there are a few incarnations of the site that were lost early on in my years, but v7 seems about right for the content I’m sharing here. In any case— I thought I’d share the “why” around the new website revamp and how I think a project like this is just what I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why did you stop blogging, anyway?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot about that lately, and the reason I stopped was that I didn’t have a reason to do it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started blogging because I was told that it was one of the things I &lt;em&gt;should be doing&lt;/em&gt; and had to &lt;em&gt;keep doing&lt;/em&gt; to get (and stay) in the Microsoft MVP program as a Front End Web Development MVP (formerly known as the Internet Explorer MVP program). Once I decided to leave the Front End Web Dev stuff behind to make way for my passion for video games and stuff, why should I bother blogging?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so that was that. I stopped blogging and made way for all the video game development effort I could muster! Sure, there was the occassional link to a YouTube video or a little tech problem that I’ve solved on the side, but for the most part, it was dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0 commercial games later, and a few false restarts I’m back on the blog and the website…again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So why bother starting it up again?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I stopped because I gave up my reason to do so. I am starting because I found a reason: I want to share and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break that down a little:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“I want to”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is probably the most important part of the whole reason. I want to make content. I’m feeling the need to do it. Maybe its habit or nostalgia for the days where creating content was part of keeping my professional status, either way it’s something I like to do and the blog is a lightweight and easy way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“share”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back to when I blogged regularly as part of my MVP contribution, I didn’t realize how much of a platform I had to share stories, advice, how-tos and whatever else. It really was quite the reach, and quite a privilege. My experience and work has changed a lot, but there is a still a lot to share for others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big difference this time around is that I’m not worried about whether or not it fits “my career goals” or my “professional focus”.  It’s really about me putting my thoughts together in a cohesive way that might help someone reflect and make a decision. In getting v7 of the website ready &lt;em&gt;I was that “someone”&lt;/em&gt; and looking over all my old posts confirmed that this is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, even if you (or me) don’t find my posts helpful in the long or short term, that’s okay. It feels good to get a post out there. There’s a gratifying feeling that comes with putting a post together that helps me, and that makes it worth it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“learn”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cliché as it sounds, I’m a life long learner. Content creation and management is something that keeps coming up in my side projects, and yet I’ve never taken the time to properly learn and understand how to do it. It’s not about the marketing side, but rather what it means to contribute, learn, and engage with your audience as a solo content creator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, there are these weird “little problems” I’ve always had in my years of creating content with with MVP program. I’m hoping that with fresh eyes and new experiences with me, I can tackle these problems with a different perspective that I have in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there is a lot to unpack here— but assuming I keep this going, I’ll continue to share what I learn, which will lead to more sharing and then more learning and…you see how this is good thing? :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Hanselman shared this idea &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes&quot;&gt;(reference)&lt;/a&gt; of valuing your effort in helping through your keystrokes (I’m greatly paraphrasing the idea). I spend time helping others one-on-one, but it’s usually the same stories, ideas, thought patterns, and so on that people find helpful. This website and blog is my chance to share new things and old with a fresh perspective, one that is owned and driven by my values and ideas and not those of my employer or community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe its selfish to think this is a good idea, but that’s fine because it’s my website, my blog, and my idea that I think is good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if I think it’s good, then that’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing. ~ DW&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[From Travis CI to GitHub Actions (and GitHub Pages)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Travis CI announced a new pricing model that could have impact on open source projects that are using Travis for continuous integration and…]]></description><link>https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/from-travis-ci-to-github-actions/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/from-travis-ci-to-github-actions/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 18:36:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Travis CI &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing&quot;&gt;announced a new pricing model&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have impact on open source projects that are using Travis for continuous integration and/or deployment. For static websites, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://westerndevs.com&quot;&gt;Western Devs website&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidwesst.com&quot;&gt;personal website&lt;/a&gt;, this could result in getting some unforeseen costs. With that in mind, we decided to take the plunge an migrate away from Travis and over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions&quot;&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; as they provide CI and CD workflows free for open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR; — Just show me the code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/westerndevs/western-devs-website/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml&quot;&gt;Here is is&lt;/a&gt;. It is open source after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just to be clear, this isn’t a tutorial on how to code this up, rather its a walkthrough on what it took to get our &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexo.io/&quot;&gt;Hexo&lt;/a&gt; based static site from Travis to GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start with Mapping Out Your Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I mean &lt;em&gt;workflow&lt;/em&gt; and not just the build. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Western Devs, our workflow goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit a change to the code (i.e. a new blog post)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If master branch build is successful, deploy the build to production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notify the Western Devs of the build result in Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub workflow provides everything we need to do this, and I’ll walk you through the code, which you can see for yourself in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/westerndevs/western-devs-website/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml&quot;&gt;here in our GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Commit a change to the code (i.e. a new blog post)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our trigger to start the workflow. That is represented by the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; section of the YAML. In our case, we want to trigger the workflow every time there is a pull request created for the master branch, a push to the master branch (i.e. a merge), or a push to any other feature (ft) or hotfix (hf) branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; CI/CD
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; master
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; ft/*
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; hf/*
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;pull_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; master &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a workflow that will trigger when we want to. Next, we need to actually build the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Build the website&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our build is exceptionally simple— just generate the site, and if the generation is successful, the build was successful. To do this, we create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; job that handles the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Build and Deploy
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ubuntu&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;latest
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/checkout@v2 &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# checkout the source code&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/setup&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;node@v1 &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# setup the environment&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;node-version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; npm install &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# setup dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; npm run build &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# run the build command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two steps are using GitHub Actions provided by GitHub themselves. This pulls our source code and the sets up the Node environment that we need to build the website. Once that is done, we  &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; steps to run shell commands to install our project specific dependendies and run the build script itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scripts have been defined in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/westerndevs/western-devs-website/blob/master/package.json&quot;&gt;project &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/a&gt; and are used by the developers to build the site locally as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. If master branch build is successful, deploy the build to production&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are talking about the master branch, we want to do a deployment if it is successful. For this step, we added a conditional expression using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;github&lt;/code&gt; context that is provided to all actions. You can learn more about context and expressions for GitHub Actions in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#about-contexts-and-expressions&quot;&gt;GitHub Docs here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also see that were using an encrypted secret using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;secret.GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; expression. All repositories have this feature in the settings section of the repo, and you can learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets&quot;&gt;creating encrypted secrets for a repository here&lt;/a&gt; in the GitHub docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Deploy to GitHub Pages
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; github.ref == &apos;refs/heads/master&apos;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; peaceiris/actions&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;gh&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;pages@v3
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;github_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;cname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; westerndevs.com
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;commit_message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; github.event.head_commit.message &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BONUS: Free hosting with GitHub Pages&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, our deployment target is &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; which provides free hosting and SSL certificates for open source static sites sites like ours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to take this opportunity to consilate everything under the GitHub umbrella because it saved us a couple of bucks, and now everything we need to manage the site is in one spot rather than spread across multiple cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Notify the Western Devs of the build result in Slack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, we had forgotten this step and started to feel it right away. So an issue was created and I put a solution in place in about 15 minutes, thanks to someone else doing all the heavy lifting and publishing their work to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&quot;&gt;GitHub Actions Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack supports incoming webhooks, even for for free workspaces. I set that up by following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks&quot;&gt;Slack documentation&lt;/a&gt;, created another secret in our repository and voila, we were back in business wih the notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Notify Slack
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; always()
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 8398a7/action&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;slack@v3
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; job.status &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; repo&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;message&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;commit&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;author&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;action&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;eventName&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;ref&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;workflow&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;job&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;took &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# selectable (default: repo,message)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages provides every developer with the opportunity to get a taste of DevOps while actually producing something they can show off to their peers and community. Travis CI is, and will continue to be, a great CI/CD solution for developers…but if you’re looking for a one-stop-shop for source control, workflow, and hosting. You can’t really go wrong with GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Artwork and a Complete Rewrite...ish | Out the Door Devlog]]></title><description><![CDATA[My effort continues on Out the Door with some new artwork, a rewrite (of sorts) to fix the build process, which has led to something of a…]]></description><link>https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/out-the-door-post-jam-update/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/out-the-door-post-jam-update/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My effort continues on Out the Door with some new artwork, a rewrite (of sorts) to fix the build process, which has led to something of a self-driven code review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Side Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release is an important one for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, off it’s the first “beta” release which I’ve categorized as a moderately stable release, and includes a “complete gameplay loop” on purpose. There are still plenty of bugs (as the video even showed) but it works and playable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, this release is the original vision of what I pictured the gamejam submission to be when D’Arcy and I came up with the idea back in April. Many months later, I have that release which says a lot about my prototyping and experimenting process (i.e. I’m too slow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have multiple versions of the game out there including Linux/X11 and Windows versions. There’s still a lot more to learn and do with the while devops setup for my projects, but this is a great step forward and can be reused with all my Godot-based projects moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the next one— thanks for playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do a lot of game development these days, and I enjoy doing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/davidwesst&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; videos, but there is something about tech and writing an blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s because I’m old. Maybe it’s because I feel intimidated and challenged by &lt;a href=&quot;https://westerndevs.com/kubernetes/kubernetes-my-journey/&quot;&gt;Dave White’s&lt;/a&gt; amazing series on his journey into Kubernetes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure, but it doesn’t matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time is my own, and I expect to write stuff on this blog related to tech, along with news of new YouTube videoes, and possibly some other nonesense along the ways. Web technology took me far, and just being out of it professionally doesn’t mean that I need to be out of it completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, expect me to write blog posts…maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concludes my test of my new blog-website architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub is a social development platform that will make your game development journey easier even if you’re not a coder! We’ll cover how GitHub can help keep your file history, through to how it can help organize your work, and even where to find cool projects to learn (and possibly contribute to). &lt;/p&gt;

Me neither, but this video will fix all that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to fall into the crutch of talking about technology rather than actually doing it. There is nothing wrong with the evangelism/marketing side of the tech community, but the whole point of me doing this is to share my journey and the tips along the way. Note the “journey” part means, I have to move the needle. An so, here we are with the first devlog of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video I cover the bit of progres I’ve had on Car Scientist, and how it’s become something of a game development sandbox to practice and (ideally) sharpen my gamedev skills. I also review the LARGE amount of planning I did and reflect a bit on how I sort through what ideas should be in this game versus the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know there are people out there who will help you with your game because they WANT TO DO IT? I know, right? This magical place is called a “community” and they exist literally all over the world. You just need to find one. In this video, I talk about four different places to find technology and game development/design communities right from where your sitting. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gamejam Pro Tips and Lessons Learned]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sharing my lessons learned from my GameOff game jam experience and how they will be applied to my game development practice moving forward…]]></description><link>https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/gamejam-protips-and-lessons-learned/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/gamejam-protips-and-lessons-learned/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sharing my lessons learned from my GameOff game jam experience and how they will be applied to my game development practice moving forward!&lt;/p&gt;

Now that I’m is moving forward with the Car Scientist game project, it’s clear that these four key points will have an impact on how his game development and design process moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past year or so, I’ve been working on learning and getting into video game development (a.k.a. gamedev) as a sort of side thing to the whole enterprise cloud architect thing that I do during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to focus my effort, I decided that I would participate in the GitHub hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2019&quot;&gt;GameOff 2019 Game Jam on Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been a ride to say the least, but as I’ve been doing it, I’ve been doing a devlog series on YouTube about my progress and my thoughts throughout the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where Do I Find the Vlog?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re in the right spot, as I’m going to cross post my &lt;a href=&quot;https://itch.io/&quot;&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt; project devlog posts here, but you can also follow along on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/davidwesst&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; if you’re into that sort of thing, or you can just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbTA1UhK0wKjTEEc_wO1n0w_hPAUIeVRf&quot;&gt;checkout the playlist here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game jam ends on December 1, and there is more work to be done, so stay tuned for more posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently started streaming twice a week on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mixer.com/davidwesst&quot;&gt;Mixer&lt;/a&gt;. The streams happen at 9:30pm CT (7:30pm PT or 10:30pm ET) on Thursdays and Sundays. Thursdays are &lt;em&gt;Code Nights&lt;/em&gt; where I fumble through the creation of a video game. Sundays are &lt;em&gt;Play Nights&lt;/em&gt; I play and analyze a game that has something interesting in it. No specific topic, just play and talk about game with the intent of finding interesting design in games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ll take a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are you a game developer now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, but I’d like to be. More specifically, I’d like &lt;em&gt;my own&lt;/em&gt; games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say I wouldn’t work somewhere that makes games, as I’m sure I’d learn a lot, but as it stands right now with my real life, I’m not willing take on the cost of doing the whole “lift and shift” to my whole career. Maybe another day, but not today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about all that web development stuff?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s still something I like and will continue to work on, but making a video game has always been something of a dream. I’ve dabbled in combining the two, but there is a lot I need to learn about game development and design that has nothing to do with code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is with the streaming?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m being honest, it’s more for me than it is for you. No offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streams act as milestones to keep it relevent in my real life. The streams are scheduled and planned for, as they are hard dates in a calendar that I can plan my life around. Playing a game keeps me thinking about what I want to see in my game, and code keeps me building the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is that why you’ve been in hiding for so long?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not intentionally, but yeah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole story behind it, but I’ll save that for another post. The short of it is that during my self imposed sabatical, I realized that I need to work on something I’m truly passionate about. That passion is video games, and this is me making sure I don’t regret trying to get myself involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I have an idea for a game…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome. Me too! Feel free to share it with me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidwesst&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/davidwesst/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://mixer.com/davidwesst&quot;&gt;Mixer Chat&lt;/a&gt; and we can chat about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does that mean you’re leaving the Western Devs?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heh, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, these people would be lost without me. Second, I’m still planning on talking about code, but likely a little less often. I’ll be reviving &lt;a href=&quot;https://davidwesst.com&quot;&gt;davidwesst.com&lt;/a&gt; in the near future where you can see all my game related content. For the time being though, only devblogs will show up over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When can I buy your game?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea. Right now, I’m toying with a prototype I call &lt;em&gt;Vagabond&lt;/em&gt; and whether that turns into a game is a whole other story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is your game code open source?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, but I’m not against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the whole selling an open source game discussion, my code is amateur at best. I’m an application web developer trying to wear the shoes of a console/PC game developer. It’s going to take some time before I feel like I know what I’m doing to actually put something out there for people to assess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I’m interested. How do I support?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, share, watch, and participate whenever and however you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really just getting started in this, and it’s going to have some rough edges. Just stay tuned and we’ll see where this takes me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide&quot;&gt;F12 Developer Tools&lt;/a&gt; are pretty great. They are the original in-browser developer tools (included in Internet Explorer 7), and have evolved into something more modern for all us “modern” developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all in-browser developer tools, I’ve found that every once and I come across an application I’m trying to debug that is so unstable that F12 can’t seem to attache properly. Whether that’s because of the application locking up the browser or whatever, without being able to attach a debugger I can’t really get into the code and start sorting out the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where the F12 Chooser comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is F12 Chooser?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F12 Chooser is a utility built into Windows that allows you choose the target application for the F12 Developer Tools without having to open Microsoft Edge itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do I run it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Windows 10, you run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;\\Windows\System32\F12\F12Chooser.exe&lt;/code&gt;. The window that comes up will display a list of targets for which you can attach the F12 tools. You can find the 64-bit version in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C:\Windows\SysWOW64\F12\F12Chooser.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/d379443d5e91abf5072a73061c251e4b/ch1TjEr.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it gives you another option when it seems like the F12 tools are failing. If your browser locks up when you try and debug your application code, you should try the F12 Chooser once the application has loaded in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also allows you to target applications that aren’t necessarily web applications that you view in a browser. For example, maybe you’re looking to debug an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/debug-add-ins-using-f12-developer-tools-on-windows-10&quot;&gt;Office Add-In&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, you have the F12 Chooser as another way to load up and attach the F12 developer tools in Windows 10 to help you with debugging web applications, web extensions, and even other things like Office Add-Ins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now you know it exists. You’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Picking between TypeScript and JavaScript]]></title><description><![CDATA[Which one should you pick: TypeScript or JavaScript?

They are both great languages, people always ask me when you should use one or the other. This post puts that to rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s a work project or a personal one, the question “TypeScript or JavaScript” always seems to come up in my mind. Utlimately, they provide a very similiar function considering that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, and compiles down to JavaScript itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not the only person that has this question either. Over the past year, I’ve asked a number of JavaScript/TypeScript developers about how they pick between the two and I wanted to sum up my thoughts here after being influenced by my private panel of experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It Depends on the Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is never one answer for everything, and this is no different. That being said, there are a few criteria or “flags” that help me select when I want to use one over the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;JavaScript Knowledge is Assumed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into it, let me clarify that I’m assuming that the developer(s) working on the project already know JavaScript. They don’t need to be experts, but they are familiar with writing vanilla JavaScript for applications, whether that be client or server side code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I’m also assuming that a TypeScript-focued developer can get their way around JavaScript code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When to TypeScript&lt;/h2&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fall to TypeScript when I am writing more than one or two code files or if I’m writing code that I expect someone else to have to run. Although I use TypeScript, the it’s not necessarily the language itself that I want, but the TypeScript compiler as it helps the other developers running my code, and removes the ambiguity of types between functions or classes that need to work togther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does a lot of stuff for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catches errors, especially typing ones, at compile time rather than run time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sets standards around what JS-like conventions I want to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better legacy browser support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports multiple module practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that compiler is powerful and I put a lot of trust into it considering I expect that the compiled code to be optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But doesn’t the compiler work on JavaScript too?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Yes it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catch is that the compiler is not as thurough as it is with TypeScript. When you add the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;//@ts-check&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript#_type-checking-and-quick-fixes-for-javascript-files&quot;&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt; at the top of your JavaScript file in Visual Studio Code, that really helps with the development story of any JavaScript code, but it’s still not as deep as using TypeScript itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TypeScript with the TypeScript compiler gives you that little bit of extra help in development, and that is really where the value comes in for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When to JavaScript&lt;/h2&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to use JavaScript when I’m only writing a little bit of code and don’t want to deal with the overhead of setting up the compiler for the project. For examples, when I’m writing a little Node script, or experimenting with REST API and want a simple GUI, I’ll quickly put together some vanilla JS code and get something working quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I write the majority of my JavaScript in &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; which provides a lot of JavaScript tooling support using the TypeScript compiler underneath the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, when I have to pick between JavaScript or TypeScript I lean towards TypeScript. It provides the better development story between the two, and that’s a really important factor when I’m writing and sharing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m lazy and don’t want to setup a TypeScript project, I fall back on JavaScript but still rely on the built-in TypeScript tooling in Visual Studio Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TypeScript provides the tooling and needed bit of abstraction from the implementation with its compiler. Even though JavaScript has come a long way with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tc39/ecma262&quot;&gt;ECMA-262&lt;/a&gt; getting plenty of updates, there is still the challenge of browser vendors supporting the spec and so on. In the end, the overhead of setting up your project to using the TypeScript compiler outweighs the complexity that large JavaScript projects bring to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when JavaScript is “feature complete”, I’m guessing that TypeScript will still provide a stronger developer story for larger software projects, while JavaScript will continue to provide the foundation for the web platform, and TypeScript itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crowdsourcing Documentation is Cool]]></title><description><![CDATA[The idea of these large enterprises crowdsourcing their technical documentation is pretty cool.

&lt;p&gt;The idea of these large enterprises crowdsourcing their technical documentation is pretty cool. More cool than I had originally realized and, for that reason, I want to take a moment to explain why I like it and why you should get involved yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do you mean by “Crowdsourcing”?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to web platforms, many of the platform owners (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/awsdocs&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mdn&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;) have started crowdsourcing their technical documentation. When I say &lt;em&gt;crowdsourcing&lt;/em&gt; I mean that the organization opens up the conversation about what the documentation should say to the community at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community, being the consumers of the product (and the documentation) can have input into adding, editing, or removing sections of official product or platform documentation. Assuming the vendor agrees with the changes being suggested, then the change is accepted and the official documentation is updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole process if facilitated generally by GitHub, where documentation is published as source code and pull requests act as the avenue submitting changes. This way, the conversation about the changes is tracked, shared, and kept in the open for people to review and understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, using things like contributors guides and automated build tools can be integrated with GitHub to validate the change, to make sure that the change to the documentation doesn’t break anything and follows any rules the vendor has in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where is the coolness?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of cool points I’d like to highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consumers are More Qualified than Vendors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers of the platform itself are somewhat qualified considering they know the inner workings of the product, but they aren’t the ones using it. The people using the product don’t need to know how the guts work, they need to how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nobody more qualified to update product documentation than the consumers of the documentation and technology. The people that are neck deep and actually &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; in tech to make things happen. Those are the people that are best suited to critique and ultimately improve the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transparent Conversations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you crowdsource your documentation, you need to make it open and accessible, which tends to make conversation around the documentation transparent. In our case, GitHub provides the facilty to make this happen with public repositories filled with documentation and through the issue and pull request interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can submit pull requests and issues and have a conversation with the vendor about their documentation and ultimately their product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that starts out like a minor update, could result in an entire section. In my case, I was confident that I’d be adding new pages of content, but once I got into the thick of it, I realized all the parts were already present in the docs. I just needed to add some context and minor updates to what was already there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, anyone reviewing the documentation for a tool or technology should check to see if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s open to improvement through crowdsourcing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can think they can make it better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a great way to get involved in your technology community, all while improving the developer experience for the next person that comes along.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Windows Subsystem for Linux is Cool.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidwesst.blob.core.windows.net/blog/websummit-wsl/ubuntu-install.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Installing Ubuntu on Windows 10 from the Windows Store&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Fall Creators Update for Windows 10, you can go to the Windows Store and install Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’s a thing now and it’s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a new Windows feature that allows Linux distributions like Ubuntu and OpenSUSE to run inside of Windows. Essentially, this let’s you run Linux-based command line applications against your files stored in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is that cool?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s cool because a lot of the web runs on Linux, but many of us develop on Windows because the business runs on the Windows platform. This means that the dev tools you have installed to run your build and test your application are the Windows versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not seem like a big deal, but it’s definitely a discrepancy. How are you expected to catch Linux issues before you deploy if you’re running Windows? The WSL, that’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Isn’t this just CygWin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it’s different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cygwin.com/&quot;&gt;CygWin homepage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cygwin is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a DLL (cygwin1.dll) which provides substantial POSIX API functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WSL, is a layer inside of Windows that allows actual Linux distributions to run against. Microsoft is providing the foundation for Linux distributions to build upon, and keeping their hands out of the tooling itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re using CygWin, you’re not using a Linux distribution. You’re using CygWin. With WSL, you’re not using any Linux distributions unless you install them on top of the WSL. Once you do, you’re using the tooling provided and build &lt;em&gt;for that Linux distribution&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Isn’t this just Bash for Windows 10?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it’s also different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I won’t get into the weeds with it, Bash for Windows 10 was something of a precursor to the Ubuntu distribution that is in the Windows Store. Think of it as an Ubuntu for Windows preview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we’re not limited to just Bash on Ubuntu. We can install OpenSUSE and run bash on that, and eventually Fedora, and probably other flavours of Linux as time goes on. So you can run two different or three different versions of Linux against the Windows filesystem at the same time, without needing a bunch of VMs running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why don’t I just run Linux?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You totally can, this doesn’t change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a dev tool, first and foremost. It’s meant to (IMHO) provide developers a easier way to run Linux tools on Windows, with the resource boundaries and extra resource consumption of a virutal machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you’re running Apache on your Linux-based web server, you no longer have to run Windows-based Apache. Rather, you can install the Linux version of Apache on Ubunut or whatever, adn directly against your Windows filesystem. No VM to prep, or system boundaries to cross. Just install and run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do I start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start by &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide&quot;&gt;installing the WSL on your Windows 10 machine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows Store animation I showed at the beginning of this post is using an &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.windows.com/en-us/&quot;&gt;Insiders Build&lt;/a&gt; of Fall Creators update for Windows 10. You can join the insiders program yourself learn about that &lt;a href=&quot;https://insider.windows.com/en-us/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the Fall Creators update, you can still start tinkering with Bash on Ubuntu for Windows 10 by following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide&quot;&gt;install instructions&lt;/a&gt; provided earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anything else?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are finally fixing the console window in Windows, so that’s a thing too. Read about it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/&quot;&gt;the team’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidwesst.blob.core.windows.net/blog/websummit-sonar/sonar-bttf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nellie the Narwhal in the Back to the Future DeLorean&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet Nellie the Narwhal. Nellie is the official mascot for &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonarwhal.com/&quot;&gt;Sonar&lt;/a&gt;, the linting tool for the web. Nellie represents a tool that is long-overdue. It provides any web application the ability to verify they are meeting a high level of quality when it comes to their web applications, and catch any improvements to implement or common pitfalls to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Sonar?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonar is a linting tool for the web. Plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It provides command line linting tool, along with some rules, that prevent developers from making some common mistakes or pitfalls with their web applications. It covers things like security, accessbility, and progressive web applications, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also create your own rules for the linter, allowing you to extend the tool to check your solutions for business specific requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it’s been &lt;a href=&quot;https://js.foundation/announcements/2017/06/22/sonar-js-foundation-welcomes-newest-project&quot;&gt;donated to the JS Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, where Microsoft continues to contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why do you want this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of devops, that’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a command line tool that can break a build if your site doesn’t meet specific requirements. Personally, I’m happy about the security and accessiblity rules they provide, but being that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com/web/websummit-pwa/&quot;&gt;I’m pretty focused on PWAs&lt;/a&gt;, I’m sure that Sonar is going to help me write better PWAs than I would have done learning on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m looking forward to breaking a build because I forgot to implement some accessibility rules. It will help me and my team learn some of these optimizations to make our web projects work best for everyone on any device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can I start using it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidwesst.blob.core.windows.net/blog/websummit-sonar/sonar-in-action.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Sonar running against WesternDevs.com showing lots of issues&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty easy: just install, initialize, and run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there is work for us to do if we want to bring our blog up to the recommended specification provided by Sonar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to set a bar of quality, whether it be the recommended standard or just your own set of standards, Sonar is the tool that can make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core items highlighted by the Microsoft Edge team, along with many others who were just web professionals, was the importance of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). I started out thinking they were something that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be interesting one day, but left the conference convinced that this will change the way we think of the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a PWA?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidwesst.blob.core.windows.net/blog/websummit-pwa/pwa-logo.svg&quot; alt=&quot;PWA Logo from diekus.net/logo-pwinter&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/&quot;&gt;Google has been talking about PWAs&lt;/a&gt; for a while now, but in my words they are web applications that use a progressive enhancement design strategy to add device native features, when available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it’s just a web app with some fancy bells and whistles, like offline loading once the site has been downloaded once and native device API access, like camera access or push notifications straight to the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it sounds like regular installed application rather than a web application, then you’re understanding this correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PWAs &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be the next wave of “apps” for our devices, but they won’t need a store front. Rather, the user can just navigate to the site and “install” the site, which can be cached for offline usage amongst other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What makes them super cool?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the coolness of extending the reach of the web into offline world, it’s also built on a set of open web standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standards give developers APIs to use across platforms, but they also give the platform holders something common to build against. Both Windows and Android have big plans for PWAs, giving web developers a whole new opportunity to use our existing skills to deliver great software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, software that can be offline and installed natively, using web development tools and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; super cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, where do I start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API&quot;&gt;Service Worker API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first step in building a great PWA, as it allows you to “install” the web application on the device. Once you have it installed, then you can worry about the rest of the functionality and how it should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, start looking at some of the new APIs that have been coming out of the W3C like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API&quot;&gt;Push API&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API&quot;&gt;Payment Request API&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API&quot;&gt;IndexedDB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should give you a good idea of what can do with a PWA rather than a regular old web application. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Posh-GVM, the Groovy Version Manager for Powershell]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here’s another dev thing I use: Posh-GVM, a Groovy version manager that works for Windows.

&lt;p&gt;You remember Groovy right? The language that was all the rage at some point with Groovy on Grails?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All kidding aside, in my adventures as an enterprise JDK developer, I’ve come across a number of Groovy on Grails applications. These projects tend to span multiple versions of Grails, ranging from 2.3.x which works on older versions of Tomcat, upto 3.2.x for of of our newer solutions. Instead of manually configuring my system for each project, I just use Posh-GVM as recommended by the folks who brought you &lt;a href=&quot;http://sdkman.io/&quot;&gt;SDKMan for Unix systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidwesst.blob.core.windows.net/blog/posh-gvm/poshgvm-example.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Posh-GVM in action&quot; title=&quot;Posh-GVM in action in a Powershell terminal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It handles switching between versions of Groovy, Grails, and a bunch more technologies without having to fuss with configuring your system. It switch between versions of Grails, Groovy, Gradle, Koitlin, and more with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gvm use &amp;lt;candidate&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; where candidate is the technology and version is…well, the version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Posh-GVM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posh-GVM is a Windows port to &lt;a href=&quot;http://sdkman.io/&quot;&gt;SDKMan&lt;/a&gt; formerly known as the GVM, or Groovy eVironment Manager. Instead of requiring a Unix system to run, it requires Powershell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install it, I followed the README instructions to install it via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flofreud/posh-gvm#via-short-script&quot;&gt;a short script&lt;/a&gt;. I tried using the PsGet method described, but didn’t have any luck finding the module. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once installed (and added to your profile) you can run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gvm help&lt;/code&gt; in the Powershell terminal and you should see a lovely help menu with all the goodies you can install and switch your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Won’t these conflict with the versions I already have installed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. It installs the tools in a different directory, so you should be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, you probably don’t need to have a local version of Grails or whatever tool installed anymore because Posh-GVM will handle that for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What makes it cool?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s cool because it works on Windows, without the need for Bash or Cygwin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that it covers a number of tools, including Grails, Groovy, and Gradle (and many more) is a pretty nifty too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the drawbacks?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two that stand out to me, but nothing that has made me abandon the tool for something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Java not included&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first being that it doesn’t support Java like it’s Unix couterpart. My guess is that Java is something special when it comes to Unix VS Windows and was eliminated for that reason. We have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com/java/jabba/&quot; title=&quot;My post on Jabba, the Java version manager for everyone&quot;&gt;Jabba&lt;/a&gt; for that on Windows, but it would be nice to have all the pieces in to the puzzle in a single tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lack of Project Activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is the lack of updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, it hasn’t been updated since &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flofreud/posh-gvm/commit/2145f8a65c5bf317e96664ebb03bf84c569ba770&quot;&gt;December 2015&lt;/a&gt; while SDKMan has continued to be actively developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as there haven’t been any pull requests in quite some time either. It’s just something I note as a risk when I adopt an open source tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think this tool is a great solution for people that need to use any of these tools, but don’t want to couple themselves to Cygwin or Bash for Windows. It has solved my Grails, Groovy, and Gradle versioning issues on Windows, and that is more than enough to make it a win in my books.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabba, the Java Version Manager for Everyone]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here’s another dev thing I use: Jabba, a cross-platform Java version manager that works for Windows.

&lt;p&gt;Over the the past few years, I’ve been doing JDK-based development in an enterprise Windows environment. In that time, I’ve continually struggled with being able to easily switch between versions of Java on my machine, depending on the project. We have legacy application that run old Java, and modern applications that run newer versions of Java. Being able to switch versions, without having to manually change my environment variables or handle mula&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that is no longer a problem thanks to my good friend, Jabba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidwesst.blob.core.windows.net/blog/jabba/jabba-example.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Jabba in Action&quot; title=&quot;Jabba in Action in a Powershell terminal&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly what you think: it changes the version of Java you’re running on the fly. No need to install anything or worry about conflicting versions, or searching out and installing the specific Java version you need for your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Jabba&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing is installing Jabba, which is a breeze thanks to the following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shyiko/jabba#windows-10&quot;&gt;instructions provided&lt;/a&gt; in the repository README. After that, I included it in my Powershell profile so it initializes it when I start Powershell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;# Jabba
if (Test-Path &amp;quot;H:\Users\dw\.jabba\jabba.ps1&amp;quot;) 
{ 
   . &amp;quot;${HOME}\.jabba\jabba.ps1&amp;quot; 
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test it out, I run a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;refreshenv&lt;/code&gt; command in the Powershell window, and run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;jabba -h&lt;/code&gt; to see if I get the help file.
The commands are pretty straightforward. You can list all the available versions, using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;jabba ls-remote&lt;/code&gt;, install the one(s) you need need with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;jabba install my-version&lt;/code&gt; and you’re good to go to run that version of Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;H:\src
&amp;gt; jabba
Java Version Manager (https://github.com/shyiko/jabba).

Usage:
  jabba [flags]
  jabba [command]

Available Commands:
  install     Download and install JDK
  uninstall   Uninstall JDK
  link        Resolve or update a link
  unlink      Delete a link
  use         Modify PATH &amp;amp; JAVA_HOME to use specific JDK
  current     Display currently &amp;#39;use&amp;#39;ed version
  ls          List installed versions
  ls-remote   List remote versions available for install
  deactivate  Undo effects of `jabba` on current shell
  alias       Resolve or update an alias
  unalias     Delete an alias
  which       Display path to installed JDK

Flags:
      --version   version of jabba

Use &amp;quot;jabba [command] --help&amp;quot; for more information about a command.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now you’re good to go with whatever version of Java your current command line needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Won’t this conflict with my installed version of Java?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shyiko/jabba#faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; section of the README covers that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I uninstalled all the different JDK’s I had installed to ensure there were no conflicts, and I like to remove tools I’m no longer needing on my machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But what about my really old legacy JDK on my machine?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shyiko/jabba#usage&quot;&gt;usage&lt;/a&gt; section of the README, you can use Jabba to install JDKs that are hosted in a custom spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the depracated versions of Java that are difficult to come by, I use the Zulu or OpenJDK versions that are available through Jabba. You can see them when you run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;jabba ls-remote&lt;/code&gt;. It’s not an exact replica of the Oracle JDK, but I haven’t hit any issues in my legacy enterprise applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What makes it cool?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My prefernce for any dev tool is to have it available through the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Java and Windows, the command line tools out there for Java are a bit limited. The standard answer seems to be to use Powershell to update your environment variables, but that doesn’t solve the need to find and install the version I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jabba solves that for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, since it’s written in Go, it works on OSX and Linux, so anyone can use the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just to put some more icing on the cake, the solo developer building Jabba was kind enough to implement &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shyiko/jabba/issues/67#issuecomment-300869749&quot;&gt;a feature I supported&lt;/a&gt; on over a weekend which made the tool work even better for me at work and at home. So, thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shyiko&quot;&gt;Stanley Shyiko&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the drawbacks?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t hit any so far, which is pretty impressive considering I use this tools almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re an enterprise Java developer that needs to support legacy applications, I would strongly suggest taking a look at Jabba. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet&quot;&gt;Windows 7 extended support ending&lt;/a&gt; in the next few years, your enterprise will be looking to move you to a new OS, Windows 10 or otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Jabba, you’ll at least have a tool that works regardless of how your development machine changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[No Cost Game Design Toolbox]]></title><description><![CDATA[In 2020, I have been focusing my energy into game design.

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that I like JavaScript, which includes &lt;a href=&quot;nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;. The history of Node releases has been fast, furious, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27309412/what-is-the-difference-between-node-js-and-io-js&quot;&gt;somewhat turbulent&lt;/a&gt; which led to a lot of different versions of Node being released. Manually managing the version of Node in you development enviornment is painful, just like it is for Java. For the Linux and Unix people, there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/creationix/nvm&quot;&gt;nvm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tj/n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/a&gt;, but nothing really comparable for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until NVS that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Node Version Switcher switches versions of Node in environment. So, if you need to jump from 4.8.4 to 6.11.1, no problem. Just a quick &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nvs add 6.11.1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nvs use 6.11.1&lt;/code&gt; and you’re ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No downloading binaries. No changing environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using NVS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although supported on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jasongin/nvs#mac-linux&quot;&gt;OSX and Linux&lt;/a&gt;, I’m going to focus on Windows as that is the environment where I use it the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two different installtion options on Windows, the first being a traditional installer file that you can download from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jasongin/nvs/releases&quot;&gt;the release page&lt;/a&gt; for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jasongin/nvs/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md#manual-setup---powershell&quot;&gt;Powershell&lt;/a&gt; or the good old fashioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jasongin/nvs/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md#manual-setup---command-prompt&quot;&gt;command line&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are described on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jasongin/nvs/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md&quot;&gt;setup page&lt;/a&gt; for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVS even supported Bash for Windows, which is pretty great for those Linux-y Windows people, although it requires a few manual configuration steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get things installed, you can run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nvs&lt;/code&gt; and go through the interactive menu goodness to get your favourite flavour of Node installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidwesst.blob.core.windows.net/blog/nvs/nvs-menu.gif&quot; alt=&quot;NVS Interactive Console Menu&quot; title=&quot;NVS Consle Menu in Action&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really dig this interactive command line menu, which was created by the NVS author for NVS, and eventually turned into it’s own library called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jasongin/console-menu&quot;&gt;console-menu&lt;/a&gt;. But that is post for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Won’t this conflict with my installed version of Node?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not from my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started with NVS, I had a version of Node installed, but I ended up uninstalling just to simplify my development environment. I kept forgetting that I had a base installation of Node installed. This confusion would result in me running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;node --version&lt;/code&gt; only to get a conflicting version number than the one I would see in my Windows Application list, and get me triaging an issue that didn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, NVS provides a feature to set a default version of using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;nvs link&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What about the global packages I’ve installed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case where you install a package globally using a certain version of Node, when you switch to a different version, you could face some problems. More specifically, around code features available in Node based on what version of Node you’ve installed, or around the nested dependencies that get installed as part of a package your project needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not an issue, as NVS provides the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;migrate&lt;/code&gt; command to move packages, global or otherwise from one version of Node to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But what about my weird, custom Node versions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No issue, because you can point to whatever directory you want as source for Node binaries using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jasongin/nvs/blob/master/doc/ALIAS.md#aliasing-directories&quot;&gt;aliasing capabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C:\Users\dw\src\_scratch
&amp;gt; node --version
v8.1.4

C:\Users\dw\src\_scratch
&amp;gt; nvs use chakracore/8.1.2
PATH -= $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvs\chakracore\8.1.4\x64
PATH += $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvs\chakracore\8.1.2\x64

C:\Users\dw\src\_scratch
&amp;gt; node --version
v8.1.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What makes it cool?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s cross-platform, so that’s pretty awesome. But, there’s more stuff that I haven’t touched on in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there is bundled integration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jasongin/nvs#vs-code-support&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; which is a huge cross-platform bonus for me. VS Code is my editor of choice, and considering that it too is cross-platform, this is pretty great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other coolness to note would be things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jasongin/nvs#aliases&quot;&gt;aliasing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;automatic directory swtiching&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jasongin/nvs#automatic-switching-per-directory&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jasongin/nvs#automatic-switching-per-directory&lt;/a&gt;). Not to mention that it supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/node-chakracore&quot;&gt;ChrakraCore&lt;/a&gt;, making it easy to turn it on for all your &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/node-chakracore#time-travel-debugging&quot;&gt;Time Travel Debugging&lt;/a&gt; needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that is icing on a delicious dev tool cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the drawbacks?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’m not sure. I haven’t found any so far, so that counts for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day NVS does the job, and it does the job well. Plus, it comes with a bunch of cool extras that can make your Node development experience even more smooth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[IstanbulJS Code Coverage Reports in VSTS]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here’s another dev thing I use: IstanbulJS in Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) builds and display the test reports as part of the build…]]></description><link>https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/istanbuljs-in-vsts/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/istanbuljs-in-vsts/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Aug 2017 12:10:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here’s another dev thing I use: &lt;a href=&quot;https://istanbul.js.org/&quot;&gt;IstanbulJS&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/continuous-integration/&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Team Services&lt;/a&gt; (VSTS) builds and display the test reports as part of the build reports. When a build completes, I get a report like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidwesst.blob.core.windows.net/blog/istanbuljs-in-vsts/vsts-code-coverage-report.gif&quot; alt=&quot;VSTS Build Report with an IstanbulJS code coverage report&quot; title=&quot;VSTS Build Report with an IstanbulJS code coverage report&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can browse the report right in the build report, and drill into the results for each file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 0: Assumptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to go into the details on how to setup IstanbulJS or a test suite, but you’ll need a project with tests and uses the IstanbulJS command line tool, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc&quot;&gt;NYC&lt;/a&gt;, to run them. My suggestion is to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://mochajs.org/&quot;&gt;Mocha&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com/development/mocha-in-vsts/&quot;&gt;the test report can be integreated into VSTS as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need a VSTS account, which is free and worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Script Your Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to be able to run a script command that will execute the appropriate code coverage command, complete with parameters, easily. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts&quot;&gt;npm scripts&lt;/a&gt; for this tutorial, but you can use whatever scripting tool you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I like to run the code coverage report everytime I run my Mocha tests. So, I’ve updated my &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt; command in &lt;em&gt;package.json&lt;/em&gt; to use NYC. It looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;  &amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;test&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./node_modules/.bin/nyc ./node_modules/.bin/mocha --recursive --reporter=mocha-multi-reporters &amp;quot;
  }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, that I don’t use globally installed packages. I only use the local ones installed in my &lt;em&gt;node\&lt;/em&gt;modules_ folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Configuring NYC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve configured it in the &lt;em&gt;package.json&lt;/em&gt; file with an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;nyc&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; configuration object. Mine looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;  &amp;quot;nyc&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;check-coverage&amp;quot;: true,
    &amp;quot;per-file&amp;quot;: true,
    &amp;quot;lines&amp;quot;: 99,
    &amp;quot;statements&amp;quot;: 99,
    &amp;quot;functions&amp;quot;: 99,
    &amp;quot;branches&amp;quot;: 99,
    &amp;quot;include&amp;quot;: [
      &amp;quot;src/**/*.js&amp;quot;
    ],
    &amp;quot;reporter&amp;quot;: [
      &amp;quot;text&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;cobertura&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;html&amp;quot;
    ],
    &amp;quot;report-dir&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./.test_output/coverage&amp;quot;
  }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part of the configuration we care about for this tutorial are the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;reporter&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;report-dir&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; properties. The rest of the configuration is out of scope for this post, but you can learn more in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc#configuring-nyc&quot;&gt;nyc README configuration section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;reporters&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, you can see that we are using three different reporters. The &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt; reporter is the one that displays in the terminal, the &lt;em&gt;cobertura&lt;/em&gt; reporter generates an XML file with all of the results which we’ll need, and the &lt;em&gt;html&lt;/em&gt; reporter generates the HTML files you saw me browsing at the beginning of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, when we run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt; we get run our tests and generate the code coverage assets we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Post-Processing the HTML Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one isn’t obvious, but I’m going to save you the trouble of discovering it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, if you don’t mind the plain text reports sans-CSS, you can skip this step altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our HTML report is going to get displayed in VSTS. Remember, the HTML report isn’t just a single file, it’s a bunch of HTML files complete with CSS for styling. VSTS doesn’t natively load up the extra CSS files, which means we’ll need to embed the CSS right into the files themselves to create a copy of the report that’ll look good in VSTS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://anthonychu.ca/post/css-styles-vsts-code-coverage/&quot;&gt;this post from Anthony Chu&lt;/a&gt;, I had a headstart on figuring out how to solve this issue. The plan is to run a post-processing script on the &lt;em&gt;posttest&lt;/em&gt; script command in npm. I called my script file &lt;em&gt;process-coverage-report.js&lt;/em&gt; and updated the scripts section of my &lt;em&gt;package.json&lt;/em&gt; to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;: {
  &amp;quot;test&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./node_modules/.bin/nyc ./node_modules/.bin/mocha --recursive --reporter=mocha-multi-reporters &amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;posttest&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;node ./tools/process-coverage-report.js&amp;quot;
},&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;posttest&lt;/em&gt; script will everytime we run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt;. You can also call it directly by running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm run posttest&lt;/code&gt; but be sure to have test results for it to process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll cut to the case, and just show you my post-processing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;let fs = require(&amp;quot;fs&amp;quot;),
    path = require(&amp;quot;path&amp;quot;),
    inline = require(&amp;quot;inline-css&amp;quot;);

const TEST_RESULTS_DIRECTORY = &amp;quot;./.test_output&amp;quot;;
const CODE_COVERAGE_DIRECTORY = &amp;quot;./.test_output/coverage&amp;quot;;

fs.readdir(CODE_COVERAGE_DIRECTORY, (err, files)=&amp;gt; {
    if(err) { throw new Error(err); }

    let reports = files.filter((report)=&amp;gt; {
        return report.endsWith(&amp;quot;.html&amp;quot;);
    });

    reports.forEach((report)=&amp;gt; {
        let filePath = path.join(CODE_COVERAGE_DIRECTORY, report);
        let options = { 
            url: &amp;quot;file://&amp;quot; + path.resolve(filePath),
            extraCss: &amp;quot;.pad1 { padding: 0; }&amp;quot;
        };

        fs.readFile(path.resolve(filePath), (err, data)=&amp;gt; {
            inline(data, options)
                .then((html)=&amp;gt; {
                    let outputFile = path.join(TEST_RESULTS_DIRECTORY, report);
                    fs.writeFile(outputFile, html, (err)=&amp;gt; {
                        if(err) { throw err; }
                    });
                })
                .catch((err)=&amp;gt; {
                    console.log(err);
                });
        });
    });
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My build doesn’t use a task runner like Gulp I settled on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/inline-css&quot;&gt;inline-css&lt;/a&gt; because I liked the API and it returned promises. If you’re using Gulp or Grunt, there are some good options (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/inline-css&quot;&gt;as suggested by Anthony&lt;/a&gt;) for you to create a task to do this for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when you run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt; you’ll end up with an extra copy of the HTML report, where you have nothing but HTML files with CSS embedded in the files themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Adding this to VSTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need to do here, is configure your build to use the new code coverage setup. We do that by adding the &lt;em&gt;Publish Code Coverage Results&lt;/em&gt; task as a build step and configuring properly. Here’s what my configuration looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version:  1.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display Name: Publish Code Coverage Results | NYC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Coverage Tool: Cobertura&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary File: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/.test_output/coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report Directory: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/.test_output     |&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your properties may vary, depending on how to configured NYC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 5: Done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we code coverage reporting showing up in VSTS. Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy code covering!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mocha Test Reports in VSTS]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here’s another dev thing I use: MochaJS in Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) builds and display the test reports as part of the build…]]></description><link>https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/mocha-in-vsts/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/mocha-in-vsts/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2017 11:19:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here’s another dev thing I use: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mochajs.org/&quot;&gt;MochaJS&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/continuous-integration/&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) builds&lt;/a&gt; and display the test reports as part of the build reports. See? Like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidwesst.blob.core.windows.net/blog/mocha-in-vsts/vsts-test-results-in-action.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Mocha Test Report in VSTS&quot; title=&quot;Screenshot of a MochaJS test report in VSTS&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t me trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. VSTS is exceptionally flexible and it comes bundled with all the pieces you need to do this out of the box. The key is making sure that we setup our test runner to produce the output VSTS needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 0: Assumptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to explain how to do this, but I’m going to assume you have a project with tests that use &lt;a href=&quot;https://mochajs.org/&quot;&gt;MochaJS&lt;/a&gt;. So, you can run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;mocha&lt;/code&gt; from the terminal and your tests run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also not going to explain that to use VSTS, you need a VSTS account. They are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/&quot;&gt;free to start&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll need one to make this work. It’s worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Script Your Test Command&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts&quot;&gt;npm scripts&lt;/a&gt; for this. I just figure out what my test command is, and then have the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt; script run that. In my project, I run the locally installed version of MochaJS and use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;recursive&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;./node_modules/.bin/mocha --recursive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;em&gt;package.json&lt;/em&gt; file, I have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;test&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./node_modules/.bin/mocha --recursive&amp;quot;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can just as easily use a Bash or Powershell script for this too if you’re not a fan of npm scripts. But you should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Use the mocha-junit-reporter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woah, wait a minute? This is JavaScript not &lt;em&gt;Java&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, but JUnit reports are a standard report format that is supported by VSTS. The key is making sure that our mocha test reports are being output into a format that VSTS can understand. VSTS does not care about your test report to standard out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mocha doesn’t come bundled with a JUnit reporter, so I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/michaelleeallen/mocha-junit-reporter&quot;&gt;mocha-junit-reporter&lt;/a&gt; which outputs a &lt;em&gt;test-results.xml&lt;/em&gt; file to the root project directory by default. I don’t like the default, so I have it output to a directory of my choosing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first we run: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install --save-dev mocha-junit-reporter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we update our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt; command in &lt;em&gt;package.json&lt;/em&gt; to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;test&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./node_modules/.bin/mocha --recursive --reporter mocha-unit-reporter --reporter-options mochaFile=./test-output/test-results.xml&amp;quot;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to add test output directory to your &lt;em&gt;.gitignore&lt;/em&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;(OPTIONAL) Step 2a: Using Mutliple Reporters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I can’t see my tests in the terminal output!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t like that either, so I fixed it by using another Mocha extension called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stanleyhlng/mocha-multi-reporters&quot;&gt;mocha-multi-reporters&lt;/a&gt;. It lets us define mutlple reporters for MochaJS and specify reporter parameters in a &lt;em&gt;config.json&lt;/em&gt; file that we save in the project root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, install the tool: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install --save-dev mocha-multi-reporters&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we update our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt; command to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;test&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./node_modules/.bin/mocha --recursive --reporter=mocha-multi-reporters&amp;quot;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, we add a &lt;em&gt;config.json&lt;/em&gt; file to the project root. I’m using the spec and mocha-junit-reporter, which result in this &lt;em&gt;config.json&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{
    &amp;quot;reporterEnabled&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;spec,mocha-junit-reporter&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;mochaJunitReporterReporterOptions&amp;quot;: {
        &amp;quot;mochaFile&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;./.test_output/test-results.xml&amp;quot;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not perfect, but it works well enough for my purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gotcha! You should use Mocha-Multi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/glenjamin/mocha-multi&quot;&gt;mocha-multi&lt;/a&gt; and I couldn’t get it to work with the parameter for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/michaelleeallen/mocha-junit-reporter&quot;&gt;mocha-junit-reporter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gotcha! This produces an xunit.xml file in the root directory&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stanleyhlng/mocha-multi-reporters/issues/35&quot; title=&quot;My bug report for the XUnit issue in mocha-multi-reporters&quot;&gt;bug with mocha-multi-reporters&lt;/a&gt; that I’ve reported. I’m hoping to get a pull request in for it soon, as it’s a pretty easy fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workaround is to add &lt;em&gt;xunit.xml&lt;/em&gt; to your &lt;em&gt;.gitignore&lt;/em&gt; file and ignore it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Run Test Script in your VSTS Build&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run your test script, you need to add a build task  in VSTS. In our case, we’re adding the NPM buid task, and configuring it to run our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt; command. The build task properties I use are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version: 1.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display Name: npm test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command: custom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command and arguments: test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidwesst.blob.core.windows.net/blog/mocha-in-vsts/vsts-npm-test-task.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of npm build step&quot; title=&quot;Screenshot of VSTS Build Task that runs the tests&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Publish the Test Results in VSTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our last step, we need to publish the test results report to VSTS and tell it how to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do this with the Publish Test Results build step in VSTS and configure it with the following properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Version: 2.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display name: Publish Test Results | Mocha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test result format: JUnit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search folder: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://davidwesst.blob.core.windows.net/blog/mocha-in-vsts/vsts-publish-test-results.png&quot; alt=&quot;VSTS Publish Test Results Build Step&quot; title=&quot;Screenshot of VSTS Build Task that consumes the test report&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 5: Done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, you’re good to go to capture and explore your MochaJS test results from within your VSTS build report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy test reporting!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Conquest April 2017 Devblog]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is the April 2017 update for my video game project I call “Conquest”.

&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, I have continued to make progress on my game project. The unexpected thing that happened was the fact that I decided to take a step back and do some research and development before continuing forward with the game idea I have in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Status Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: my game project is too big. At least for now, it’s too big, and I don’t have enough experience and knowledge to be co
fortable taking this idea and turning it into a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s my first original video game, after all, and if you watch or read game design resources like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/ExtraCreditz&quot;&gt;Extra Credits&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll often hear that you should start small and move up from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s what I did. And I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/breakout&quot;&gt;Breakout&lt;/a&gt; by following &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript&quot;&gt;this MDN&lt;/a&gt; tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that this isn’t going to blow anyone’s mind, but it’s first game I’ve made with nothing but vanilla JavaScript and let me get familiar with the basics of JavaScript game development, without blindly relaying on a framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend on continuing with this breakout game for another month as I prepare for &lt;a href=&quot;http://prairiedevcon.com/&quot;&gt;Prairie Dev Con&lt;/a&gt; to add some polish, clean up the code, and maybe add a few gameplay elements that I worked on this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, onto the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What I’ve Done&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like last time, I’ll keep it short and in bullet points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did an automated deployment to &lt;a href=&quot;https://itch.io/&quot;&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt; using Powershell and VSTS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimented with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inklestudios.com/ink/&quot;&gt;Ink&lt;/a&gt; dialogue system and found how to integrate into build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taken a step back on Conquest, in lieu of more R&amp;#x26;D through smaller games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/breakout&quot;&gt;Breakout&lt;/a&gt; with vanilla ES6 JavaScript, complete with a transpiler and SystemJS modules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrinkus/&quot;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt; for the suggestion and &lt;a href=&quot;https://love2dev.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Love from Love2Dev&lt;/a&gt; for providing constructive feedback regarding framework dependent developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup my Vim development environment to be extra cool. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Met with an &lt;em&gt;actual video game writer&lt;/em&gt; to talk about the best way to start including narrative and dialogue into a game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rmorganslade.ca/&quot;&gt;R. Morgan Slade&lt;/a&gt; for taking the time and providing some really good feedback and insight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started migrating some design elements from Conquest into Breakout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What I’ve Faced&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, the big thing I faced was the realization that my project is too big for me. It’s not that I don’t think I would finish it eventually. It’s that I don’t think I have the skills to make the game fun when I’m done with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also realized that I am too dependent on frameworks when it comes to game development. It’s not that I don’t think frameworks have a place or that I’ll eventually use one or more of them in my game. It’s that I don’t know what the framework brings to the table other than an abstraction in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of game design tools with full UI’s that remove the need to code everything from the ground up, but since I’ve opted to go the code-focused route because that’s what I know best, I should probably know a bit more about the layers code before I start abstracting them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where I’m Going&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May is going to be busy with Prarie Dev Con happening in June, but that won’t stop me from working on Conquest. I should also document these discoveries I make a little more, so I’ll be doing that through the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, my plan is to focus on polishing up Breakout by using some of the planned features for Conquest in Breakout. They might not work all that well in that game, but the goal of Breakout isn’t to make it a hit, but to experiment with these systems I have planned for Conquest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, here’s the plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor Breakout to have a cleaner code base (i.e. modules, objects, etc…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share my VSTS game development discoveries via my blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add some polish to Breakout to complete it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare my demos for &lt;a href=&quot;http://prairiedevcon.com/&quot;&gt;Prairie Dev Con&lt;/a&gt; using Breakout as the demo project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’ve concluded this month is that I need to make games that match my skills as software developer. For that reason, I’m going to focus on learning the guts of the JavaScript by improving my vanilla JS Breakout game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, this month has been quite the shift in direction. I went from making one big game, to making one small game that has nothing to do with the original. It’s been challenging, but in a good way. Now I can move forward with developing these systems in smaller pieces, refine them, and eventually recombine them into my original game design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next month.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introducing My Game Project - March 2017 Devblog]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’ve wanted to make a video game since I was very young.

It got me into programming during my university career, and is something of a passion of mine now that I’m older and more of a seasoned developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve toyed and tinkered with different game ideas and technologies through the years, but never really got anything done. At the beginning of this year, I started working on something I decided would be my first “real” game. I’m not sure what it is yet, but it’s turning into something after three month of development and design in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m going to share a bit about it with you, the public, for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introducing “Conquest”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game is something of a life long conquest for me, but that isn’t where the name comes from. This game started out as one idea where conquest made a lot of sense, but has transformed in a few ways over the past month to something completely different. I’ve been rolling with it and I like where it’s headed now, but the name is going to stay the same until I get something a little more locked down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, you can take a look the &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/a/x7eGr&quot;&gt;first official screenshots&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not much to look at, but this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to get the gameplay loop and core systems down, based on the bit of design I have in mind. I’ve been doing pitch sessions with my SO (significant other), who has helped keep me and the multitude of ideas in check. Graphics and polish will come later, but for now it’s all about the gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But enough of that, let’s get status update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Status Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of these posts is to try and help me reflect on what I’ve done, what issues I’ve faced, and where I’m going from here. Think of it as a sort of sprint review. Although this is three months of effort, I have started planning month long iterations where each iteration will end with a devblog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those wondering, I use Visual Studio Team Services for that planning, but I’ll discuss that in future regularily scheduled blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What I’ve Done&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past three months, I’ve done quite a bit, but I’ll keep it brief with bullet points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected &lt;a href=&quot;http://phaser.io/&quot;&gt;Phaser&lt;/a&gt; as the base game framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented signals for game events, triggered through timers and through player interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented in-game time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented map metadata layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup issue and bug tracking in &lt;a href=&quot;http://phaser.io/&quot;&gt;VSTS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup contiuous integration and deployment to Itch.io using VSTS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did a “pitch” to solidify game idea and core gameplay concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup a map design workflow using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mapeditor.org/&quot;&gt;Tiled&lt;/a&gt; map editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist of it is that I’ve focused on figuring out what sort of game I want to make by focusing on the things I already know: the tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What I’ve Faced&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be more specific in future posts, but most of everything I’ve faced over these past three months has been around discovery and learning how to do basic game development. By using TypeScript (with it’s definition files) and Phaser as my foundation, I’ve been moving pretty quickly and learning something new every time I sit down to work on the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other challenge I’ve is figuring out where to draw the line between development and design. At this point, I feel like I know where the line is and actually know that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a line between them. The challenge is making sure that I make sure to keep progress happening in both streams. Development work is familiar to me compared to design and ultimately more of a comfort zone for me to fall back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that without design, I’m just building game technology without purpose. How do I know what systems to build if I don’t know what kind of game I’d like to build?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve gotten much better at this over the course of February and March, and intend on keeping that going in future iterations by making sure that the number of dev and design issues are balanced each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where I’m Going&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next iteration, I’m going to try and add two more systems to the game: a dialogue system, and an objective/goal system. There are more I’d like to add, but those two are the most critical. With these two in place I think I would have all the systems I need to the first part of the game playable and in front of players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the design side, I have a vision in mind for the first playable part. To build it, I need to design my first “real” map, complete with metadata and a story that is told through interaction with the map. The other thing  will be to make sure that I use the &lt;em&gt;existing&lt;/em&gt; systems I’ve developed to tell the story through the map, rather that defining new systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the goals for the sprint are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display scripted dialogue in-game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include objective for the player to accomplish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map of first playable section that tells a story through interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage the each of the existing systems in the map to aid in story telling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is the first of many. They will be monthly, and have more specific content about progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a first post, this is pretty light on the details. That’s mainly because there aren’t a lot of details to share just yet. For now, all I can say is that I plan on continuing to blog about both the technical and the design challenges that I face along the way. Hopefully, over the next few posts, I will have something for you to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next month.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Compile TypeScript into a Single File with SystemJS Modules with Gulp]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’ve been messing around with TypeScript again for my game project and wanted a module loader to consume the single file produced by the…]]></description><link>https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/how-to-compile-typescript-into-a-single-file-with-systemjs-modules-with-gulp/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/how-to-compile-typescript-into-a-single-file-with-systemjs-modules-with-gulp/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2017 09:47:22 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been messing around with TypeScript again for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2017/03/Intital-Thoughts-on-Using-Phaser/&quot;&gt;game project&lt;/a&gt; and wanted a module loader to consume the single file produced by the TypeScript compiler. This time around I decided to use SystemJS and figured I’d share the lessons I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Sample Project&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in playing with the code, you can checkout &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/ts-systemjs&quot;&gt;this GitHub project&lt;/a&gt; I setup just for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Previous Post&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also posted about doing the same sort of thing &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/09/How-to-Compile-Typescript-into-a-Single-File-with-AMD-Modules/&quot;&gt;with AMD and RequireJS&lt;/a&gt; complete with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/ts-project-template&quot;&gt;a GitHub sample project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Project Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the gist of it. My project has the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source code in TypeScript, organized in to multiple modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load external modules into application as dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transpile down to a single bundle file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load the bundle in the browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty straight forward, right? Plus, because I’m using TypeScript I figured this would be easy peezy lemon-squeezy with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html&quot;&gt;TypeScript compiler&lt;/a&gt; and rich documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, it wasn’t that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wait. Where’s GulpJS?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s in the sample project handling the transpiling the TypeScript through a task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s actually not required, but rather a convienience for keeping all my build tasks together. I just put it in the title, because it matches the previous post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem 1: Using an External Module&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://momentjs.com/&quot;&gt;Moment.js&lt;/a&gt; to help handle date objects with my code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two parts to this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting it working in the development environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting it bundled up with SystemJS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using it in Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;, which is a great TypeScript development environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, you would use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40types&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@types&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; collection of defintion files from the NPM which is wired up by default. For Moment, we need to break that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition file for Moment is found in the library itself. Since I use NPM to handle all my dependencies, you just set this up in your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;img
        class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot;
        alt=&quot;TyAgU0N&quot;
        title=&quot;TyAgU0N&quot;
        src=&quot;/static/beb1039f624d5c4f75886e0320eca97d/6bdcf/TyAgU0N.png&quot;
        srcset=&quot;/static/beb1039f624d5c4f75886e0320eca97d/c26ae/TyAgU0N.png 158w,

        sizes=&quot;(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px&quot;
        style=&quot;width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;&quot;
        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in code, we import it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; moment &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;moment&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: if your project is already using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@types&lt;/code&gt; definition files, you’ll need to add that folder to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;typeRoots&lt;/code&gt; collection yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bundling it Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we’re using SystemJS, we need to do is configure it as a path to understand where to find the library when it gets referenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/ts-systemjs&quot;&gt;sample project&lt;/a&gt;, we do it in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; tag on the HTML page, but you can do this in wherever you end up doing your SystemJS configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;SystemJS&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;paths&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;moment&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.17.1/moment.min.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem 2: Loading the Bundle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a bundle is easy. Consuming the bundle is something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making a Bundle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in bundling your code into a single file with the compiler, you’re limited to AMD or SystemJS modules. This is configured in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; file included in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/ts-systemjs&quot;&gt;the sample project&lt;/a&gt; with the module property. You can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html&quot;&gt;here in the TypeScript Handbook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consuming the Bundle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I got stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have this fancy bundle, but I need to figure out how to consume it in my HTML page. The solution is pretty simple, but it took some research and some tinkering, but I got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; take of the HTML file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;display&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- script will display content here --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/systemjs/0.20.9/system.js&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;bundle.js&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token language-javascript&quot;&gt;
        SystemJS&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;paths&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;moment&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.17.1/moment.min.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        SystemJS&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;game&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; g &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Game&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;display&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;error&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blame myself for getting stuck considering this sort all documented well in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs&quot;&gt;SystemJS documentation on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Either way, I had issues finding solid resources about using bundles. Hopefull this can help someone else in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problems can be traced back to my lack of experience with JavaScript module loaders. And yes, I know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module&quot;&gt;ES6 Modules are coming&lt;/a&gt;, but the browsers are a ways away from having a full implementation (except for Safari). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, we’ll be using TypeScript and &lt;a href=&quot;http://babeljs.io/&quot;&gt;Babel&lt;/a&gt; to help us get our modular JavaScript working in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Initial Thoughts on Using Phaser]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’m not a game dev, but have always wanted to make a video game.

I’ve started and stopped so many project over the years, that I have seriously lost count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new year and a fresh mind, I decided to take a stab at it again, this time focusing on just getting something done rather than getting something &lt;em&gt;done right&lt;/em&gt; as a sort of side project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been about two months since I’ve started, and I have something basic working (although I’m not willing to share it yet) and I thought I would share my thoughts on Phaser, the framework I decided to use to help me build my game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Techincal Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we talk about the framework, let’s talk about the game itself as you’ll need to know what I’m building to understand why I chose the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the technical rundown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-Down Camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tile-based graphics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapeditor.org&quot;&gt;Tiled&lt;/a&gt; for maps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gamepad support for player input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TypeScript support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think back to the old NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) and SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System) days, games like Final Fantasy, and the Legend of Zelda are good examples of the look of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where did you come up with these Requirements?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make a game that I wanted to play. That’s really about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have plenty of ideas floating around in my head, but I went with one that had a look and feel of what I like to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why TypeScript Support?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I’m a JavaScript nut, if find that TypeScript combined with the right tooling (Visual Studio Code) helps you learn an API thorugh code completion. Plus, it’s compiler helps catch errors along the way without losing the versatility that comes with JavaScript. Since I’m learning a whole new domain (i.e. game development) I wanted to focus more on the learning practices and patterns, rather than worrying about the syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll get into more of this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wait! What about the Game Design?!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a whole other conversation and series of posts that I may share if I ever get this project done. For now, they don’t really apply as we’re sticking to the technical side of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Although if you’re interested, ping me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidwesst&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to let me know)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, Why Phaser?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did quite a bit of research on this before going with Phaser. The two biggest contenders being &lt;a href=&quot;http://babylonjs.com/&quot;&gt;BabylonJS&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.createjs.com/&quot;&gt;CreateJS Suite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, Phaser not only did everything I needed it to do, but it  has a very strong community of support through &lt;a href=&quot;http://html5gamedevs.com/&quot;&gt;HTML5GameDevs&lt;/a&gt;, and it does everything I need it to do. Plus, I had already tinkered with it a bit so that definitely gave it some extra points during the selection project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’m beyond the “tinkering” phaser, and into building a full game, I think I can weigh-in on the pros and cons I’ve come across thus far. I’m not far enough along to talk about performance, but for my little game project it seems to be running smoothly without fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support is Amazing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, the support from &lt;a href=&quot;http://html5gamedevs.com/&quot;&gt;HTML5GameDevs&lt;/a&gt; is great. The forums are active, and there is even a live chat for people that are registered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve only asked one question so far, and it was answered very quickly. The rest of the time, I search the forums for my question and 99/100 times I’ll find an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://phaser.io/examples&quot;&gt;examples section&lt;/a&gt; of the Phaser website gives links great code snippets that help wrap your brain around how to do things with the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, as they prepare Phaser v3, the community has taken on Phaser v2 and has continued to release patches to the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Focuses on 2D&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m just starting to learn game development and, on top of that, I’m doing this in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get stuck I don’t know what I don’t know, but I can generally find my way around questions and articles that discuss 2D games. Since Phaser focuses on 2D, it makes consuming the API much more familiar to me rather that navigating my way around 3D game API (i.e. BabylonJS) that bring a whole new vocabulary to the table that I have to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Phaser-CE is What You’re Looking For&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that they fixed it on the website, but when I was starting on this project there was no mention of &lt;em&gt;Phaser-CE&lt;/em&gt; on the homepage, and so I thought version 2.6.2 was the latest and greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, that was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you’ll see &lt;a href=&quot;https://phaser.io/download/stable&quot;&gt;here on the Phaser site&lt;/a&gt;, version 2.6.2 was the last officially supported release, while v2.7.x is the community edition that is supported by those fine community members I mentioned earlier. So, when you install your dependency with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install phaser&lt;/code&gt; you are installing an old version of the framework. You want &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install phaser-ce&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change was minimal, considering it’s the same framework. It just took me for a loop as I only figured this out as I tried to submit a pull request, only to find out that I was using the wrong version of Phaser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;JavaScript First, TypeScript Second&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted TypeScript support up front because I knew it would help me get into the Phaser APIs. Now that I’m becoming more familiar with everything, I feel as though I should have toughed it out and stuck with JavaScript and Babel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TypeScript definition files are part of the library and are not available on through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/npm&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@types&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the NPM. From what I can gather, they are done by hand. This isn’t a big deal considering they work fine, but it makes me question their accuracy, especially not being avaialble through &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;@types&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t regret choosing Phaser as it met all my short term goals and I’m still learning a lot about game development and Phaser (and it’s community) is helping me with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time around, assuming Phaser v3 isn’t done yet, I would proabably go with &lt;a href=&quot;http://babylonjs.com/&quot;&gt;BabylonJS&lt;/a&gt; as it gives you everything Phaser does, but adds some pretty powerful tooling and 3D support along with it, and has the TypeScript support I expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, Phaser has been a great place to start with game development. I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Blog with VSTS (Part 4)]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is part 4 of 5 of my How to Blog with VSTS series.

&lt;li&gt;Part 5: Release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been tinkering with Visual Studio Team Services off and on since its public release, but never did anything really productive with it. Over the past couple of weeks, I finally bit the bullet and decided to move my most prevelant personal project into VSTS: this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we are we going to create a build script in VSTS so we can generate our blog content consistently and get it ready to deploy somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating Our Build Script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to navigate over to the &lt;em&gt;Build&lt;/em&gt; section of VSTS, which you can find in the navigation menu at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adding Build Tasks (Hexo Edition)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VSTS provides plenty of build tasks. Statically generated sites will have different build tasks, so I’m going to walk you through the build tasks I setup for &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexo.io/&quot;&gt;Hexo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty straight forward, but it helps to list them out in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install global npm dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install local npm dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other stuff that needs doing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate site content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store site content as build asset OR Deploy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go through these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;npm Global Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I only have one which is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hexo-cli&lt;/code&gt; so that I can run the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hexo generate&lt;/code&gt; command later on in our build. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could add it’s own npm task here, by adding a new task and setting the parameters of the task accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- npm install -g task --&gt;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don’t have a separate task. I use my project’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; and set a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;preinstall&lt;/em&gt; script&lt;/a&gt; which gets run before the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either one works really. I just like having my source code setup be as simple as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt; to run the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;npm Local Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the previous, except this time we’re using the default parameters. We just need the build to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; and let it do it’s thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other Stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every project is a unique snowflake, and sometimes you have some extra tasks you need accomplished. In my case, I have a custom theme that I build every time. To accomplish this, I have a PowerShell script in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;\tools&lt;/code&gt; directory of my source code that gets run every time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CMD, Powershell, and Bash Tasks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re not limited to just PowerShell, but you can have CMD or even bash shell scripts executed. The only caveat of running these is making sure that the build server being used to run your build has these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re using the hosted server, like I do, then PowerShell and CMD are your best bets. I did try to have both PowerShell and Bash, which resulted in getting a message saying I “didn’t have a host that had these capabilities”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe in time we’ll have hosted servers that do both, but until then you’ll need to setup your own server to handle these unique dependencies or try can conform your code to use one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Keeping it Open Source&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to keep your source open on, you’ll likely want to push it out of VSTS and into GitHub or somewhere where the public can get their hands and eyes on it.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the job for another script task. In my case, I followed &lt;a href=&quot;https://nkdagility.com/open-source-vsts-tfs-github-better-devops/&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com/bios/dylan_smith/&quot;&gt;Dylan Smith&lt;/a&gt; directed me to and followed along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Generate Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, another script task. But this one is easier, as we’re just running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hexo generate&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could write a whole script file for this too, but I opted to make it simple and just configure the build task itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- hexo generate build task --&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Save and Publish Site Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll discuss this further when we get to &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt; but we need to save our content assets so we can publish them later. For hexo, this is usually the contents of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To handle this, I use the &lt;em&gt;Copy and Publish Build Assets&lt;/em&gt; task and configure it to save the contents of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder so that it persists after the build is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;…or Deploy!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is to just deploy it directly from the build script and skip the whole &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;release management&lt;/a&gt; component. This would allow you do a deployment everytime you build, making sure the latest source code is live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, it’s a matter of preference. The reason I like &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt; over this model is to be able to manage the release of source code independenly of the build itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Triggering the Build&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two build scripts that are almost identical. One that I use for development and continuous integration. The other is scheduled to prepare a for a weekly release of my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VSTS accomodates both of these options, which you can see in the &lt;em&gt;Triggers&lt;/em&gt; tab of the build script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my development build script, I trigger the build on pushes to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch of my repository. I have also configured this build script to run on a private build agent that I have setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t be covering private build agents in this series of posts, but I assure you it’s very easy. I setup my development machine as a private build server, and had it setup in about 15 minutes after following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/admin/agents/v2-windows&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Up: Releases!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re almost done, and technically you don’t need the next step if you just want to do continual deployment and have a deployment step in your build script. That being said, I like having the release pipeline as it gives me a few other things to ensure my blogging goes out without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Part 4: Build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 5: Release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been tinkering with Visual Studio Team Services off and on since its public release, but never did anything really productive with it. Over the past couple of weeks, I finally bit the bullet and decided to move my most prevelant personal project into VSTS: this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we are going start blogging in a controlled and coordinated manner by planning and using the &lt;em&gt;Work&lt;/em&gt; tab in our VSTS project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is there to plan?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty. Although features and bugs are obvious use for &lt;em&gt;Work&lt;/em&gt; tab, my primary use case is post planning. I’ll be focusing on using &lt;em&gt;Work&lt;/em&gt; for blog posts, but realize that you can use these same practices for adding new enhancements or logging bugs in your blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post Ideas in the Backlog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to have a lot more ideas for posts than I write. Ideas are quick and easy, but writing them (at least writing them properly) is the time consuming part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to write a post for every idea, I use the backlog to save my post ideas as they come up. In an Agile project, I create new user story for every post idea and tag it as a “post” so that I can easy filter them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user story title is the idea for the post title, and I use the description to outline the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Blogger Note&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title and the outline are only two things I fill out on the work item, but without both I don’t even bother saving the item because I won’t remember the context without the outline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planning my Posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a post backlog, I start planning what posts I am going to write. In my case, this is just like sprint planning and VSTS makes this easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting up Iterations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, I setup my iterations. I like planning about one month at a time, so I go with 4-week iterations and named by the month that consumes most of the iteration. This all happens in the &lt;em&gt;Work&lt;/em&gt; configuation section of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;del&gt;Sprint&lt;/del&gt; Post Planning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have iterations, I plan what posts I want to write for the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do this by dragging the posts onto the iteration on the right side, and adding tasks as described by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/work/scrum/sprint-planning&quot;&gt;VSTS team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/62eaebfef70e1187bd69d40a48dfccf9/67xoqOK.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Adding a User Story to an Iteration&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tasks and Templates&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although tasks on a blog post work item might sound excessive, my writing process has multiple steps to try and make it easy for me to blog. First I write the initial draft (text-only), followed by proof reading and filling in the images and links that I’ve left. Sometimes there are other tasks like updating links on old posts, like on this post which is part of a series of posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the tasks are so similar, I created a quick template that I apply to a work item that automatically puts in the tags and general tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why do all this Planning?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planning takes me about 15 minutes a month, but it’s still a fair question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because my blog is something I do on my own time, I need to stay organized so that I can go from 0 to writing in 5 minutes. Between my day job, side project, family, social committments, and supporting a local user group, my time is limited. When I have 30 minutes, I try and get something done as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that without planning a lot of my time was spent trying to figure out what I did last time I blogged. Even if it only takes like 20 or 30 minutes to get myself sorted out and blogging, sometimes that is all the time I have to commit. If I spend all my time getting ready to blog, I won’t have any time to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing a Post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know what we’re writing about, we can start writing posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we’re using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.staticgen.com/&quot;&gt;static site generator&lt;/a&gt; a post is a new markdown file and possibly couple of image files. This is analagous adding a new feature to any other software project, and thus it is treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I create a new &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;topic branch&lt;/a&gt; for the post. Since I host my source code in VSTS, I use the web UI to create a new branch in the work item. On my local machine, I create a new local branch that is mapped to the new remote branch and start create a new draft post with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hexo new draft &amp;quot;My Post Title&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a new post file in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;source\_drafts&lt;/code&gt; folder of the project, and I start writing and going through the tasks. As I complete the tasks I make commits and associate them with the tasks and work items by adding the ID numbers in the messages. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; commit -m &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;wrote initial draft. part of #201 closes task #212&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#201&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;#212&lt;/code&gt; get picked up by VSTS and associate them with the cooresponding task and user story, just like it does in GitHub. Unlike GitHub, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;closes&lt;/code&gt; key word doesn’t actually close the work item, which I don’t mind, but should be noted for those coming from GitHub like I did.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why a Pull Request?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, another good question. You’re pretty good at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might it’s completely unnecessary for a solo project like a blog, I like to use them for a few reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, VSTS (just like GitHub) gives you a web-based interface for reviewing all the code you’re about to merge into your branch. This gives me an opportunity to review my post and to make sure all the pieces are in place. I’m usually about a week ahead of each post, so doing a pull request&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it makes the merge a bit more noticeable in the project. When I have a Pull Request waiting, my Visual Studio Code plugin will highlight it in the status bar, and it will also show up in the web-based UI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, and most importantly, it provides me a way to publish a post without needing to have access source code and a git command line. When I’m ready to share a post, I merge a pull request into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch which then triggers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-4/&quot;&gt;build&lt;/a&gt; and eventually a &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;, which we will cover in future posts. All of that can be done from the web UI, which means as long as I have an internet connection on a device, I can login and publish a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What about Scheduling Posts?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to do that with Hexo and plenty of other static site generators. In my case, I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-4/&quot;&gt;Build&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Release&lt;/a&gt; parts of VSTS to manage this for me. To be continued…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ready. Set. Blog!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re saving post ideas as user stories, writing posts and committing them to their own topic branches, and triggering a publish workflow through Pull Requests which gives us an opportinity to do proof read prior to publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, we’re going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-4/&quot;&gt;Build&lt;/a&gt; our blog.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Blog with VSTS (Part 2)]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is part 2 of 5 of my How to Blog with VSTS series.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-3/&quot;&gt;Part 3: Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-4/&quot;&gt;Part 4: Build&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 5: Release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been tinkering with Visual Studio Team Services off and on since its public release, but never did anything really productive with it. Over the past couple of weeks, I finally bit the bullet and decided to move my most prevelant personal project into VSTS: this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we are going to get our blog setup in source control so we can start add posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You Don’t Need Your Code in VSTS to Use VSTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VSTS is an all-in-one solution for your software project. Source control is a part of that solution, but it should be noted that &lt;em&gt;you don’t &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to use VSTS hosted source control&lt;/em&gt; to use VSTS. I had originally setup my project just to mess with builds, releases, and work items. All my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/dw-blog&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; lived exclusively on GitHub, and VSTS still worked just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difference I’ve found is a few “nice to have” features in the Work tab, which we’ll cover &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-3/&quot;&gt;in the next post&lt;/a&gt;. Generally speaking, though, there isn’t any significant differences or advantages with using VSTS to host your code except for convienience and those few “nice to have” features I mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But I Want to Stay Open Source!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VSTS &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; provide you with a public view of your source code. This is my major criticism of the &lt;em&gt;Code&lt;/em&gt; features, and for VSTS as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, if I want people to be able to view my source code (which I do) then GitHub is a much better platform for that purpose. Consider that GitHub is ubiquitous with open source software development, so much so that even Microsoft uses it to share source code. People are more likely to find my code on GitHub than the focused platform that is VSTS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the visibility is a project. To solve this just use both. I use the private repositories of VSTS as my working repos where a have a ton of branches and use that for my builds, feature development and so on. When my work is done, I publish my branches to GitHub where people could make pull requests, review my code, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense I use VSTS for internal development and GitHub for external/public development and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But Now My Development Isn’t Transparent!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re right, other than my git history, it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as previously mentioned, you don’t need to use VSTS to host your source code or your work items (as you’ll see in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-3/&quot;&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt;). You just need to use the parts you want, and use other tools as you see fit. If you only want to use VSTS for the builds and releases and GitHub for source control and issue tracking, then by all means go ahead and do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, my blog is a one man show that doesn’t really get a lot of people reviewing the source code. I don’t need the transparency for a project this small, but I still like keeping code visible and I keep tabs on the GitHub repository by using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=YodLabs.yodlabs-githubstats&quot;&gt;GitHub Stats Widget from Yod Labs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re still interested in using the code tab, then keep calm and carry on. If not, you can jump ahead to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-3/&quot;&gt;Work&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-4/&quot;&gt;Builds&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Releases&lt;/a&gt; posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The “Code” Tab&lt;/h2&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you open up your project in VSTS, you’ll see the “Code” link in the header. This is where we’ll be living for the duration of this post. I am also assuming that did as I did in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/10/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-1/&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; and selected Git as the type of source control you want to use for your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Default Project Repository&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you setup your project, you’re given a default project repository with the same name of the project. In my case, I have a repository called &lt;em&gt;davidwesst.com&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could use this to store the source code of your blog, but I tend to use this repository as a project wiki that spans all repositories. When you click on the “Welcome” link on your project home page, you can see a rendered version of the README.md files in each of your repositories. This repository ends up acting as the “root” of all documentation on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you delete it and go back to the Welcome page you get this message:&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since VSTS has a decicated spot for it anyway, I figure it makes sense to use it for cross-repository documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating Your Blog Repository&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the repository dropdown menu and select &lt;em&gt;New Repository&lt;/em&gt;. Name it and you’re ready to push source code up to VSTS. Just follow the your static site generators instructions to setup your blog, and push the code up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already have your blog published somewhere else like GitHub, you can use the &lt;em&gt;Import Repository&lt;/em&gt; feature and clone the source and the history into VSTS.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;For Those Using Hexo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re using Hexo as your static site generator, you can follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexo.io/docs/setup.html&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; to get setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you push, make sure you add a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file that excludes the &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;node\&lt;/em&gt;modules_ as those folders contain the generated static content and generator dependencies, which we don’t need to store in source control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing Blog Posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will tackle this topic again in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-3/&quot;&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt; but for now I want to describe the workflow I use to write blog posts. It should be noted that the workflow I’m about to describe works in either VSTS or GitHub. I used it in GitHub for a long time, and it continues to serve me well in VSTS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a summary of what I do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new branch off of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the post and commit all files to the new branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Pull Request to pull the post branch into &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approve the PR when I’m ready to publish the post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post Branches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a static site, or in this case a static blog, each post is a new file (or files if you’re including images). I think of each post as a new feature and use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows#Topic-Branches&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;topic branch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch is my most recent and stable code, and so each post is a branch off of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;. In short, I do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; checkout -b post/my-new-post
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# ...write the post...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; --all
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; commit -m &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;wrote new post&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; push -u origin post/my-new-post&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m done, the branch contains everything I need to publish the post. All I need to do is merge, but I generally don’t do that from the command line on my machine. Rather, I use Pull Requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pull Requests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed the Pull Requests link in the header earlier, which is a nice way to merge a post branch without needing a computer with the project setup. In my case, I tend to write my posts in advance and want to publish them on Monday mornings. I don’t necessarily want to have to open up a command line and do the merge and push from my workstation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Pull Requests, I can do the merge from any web browser, and it forces me to give myself a code review. I look over the spelling and grammar and make sure everything looks good. When I’m done, I click “Complete” and it’s merged into my master branch, which is what is used to generate the site content and published to my web host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Part 5: Release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been tinkering with Visual Studio Team Services off and on since its public release, but never did anything really productive with it. Over the past couple of weeks, I finally bit the bullet and decided to move my most prevelant personal project into VSTS: this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post covers the setup, and more specifically what I use to produce my lovely blog. We’ll get into the thick of it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-2/&quot;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Woah. VSTS &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; for a Blog?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know. Let me address this first before we continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s definitely overkill. But, it provided me with a great learning experience for VSTS and the application lifecycle management tools is provides. It also was something that I’ll actually use on a regular basis, as you’ll see if you get through the whole series of posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes it’s like using a grenade launcher to kill an ant. That being said, it definitely gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I use in my blog project, and what you’ll need if you’re going to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hexo or another Static Site Generator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not familiar with static site generators, they are great for developers looking to blog or create simple sites. I won’t be going into the details on how to use one, but they all seem to provide a similar sort of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you do is add files, generally in &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, fill out the configuration file, and run the generate command. The generator then generates a series of static HTML files from your content and then you have the files you need to publish to a web server somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No server-side code, no database, just a bunch of files. Real simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexo.io/&quot;&gt;Hexo&lt;/a&gt; for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, and it is used for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com&quot;&gt;Western Devs&lt;/a&gt; site. It works well, and makes scripting your build and deployment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-3/&quot;&gt;which we’ll see later&lt;/a&gt;) much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like Hexo then take a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.staticgen.com/&quot;&gt;look here&lt;/a&gt; for a bunch of static site generators based in a variety of languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Visual Studio Team Services Account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign up for the free account &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualstudio.com/vsts-test/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and create a new team project. I used the &lt;em&gt;Agile&lt;/em&gt; process because I found it gave me the flexibility I wanted, and &lt;em&gt;Git&lt;/em&gt; for source control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more details about the project processes available, and the differences between them, take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/work/guidance/choose-process&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Web Host&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like any website, you’re going to need a place to host it. Lucky for us, we’re only hosting static files which makes the options pretty open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using Windows Azure, which again is overkill considering it’s just static files, but I like it. If you don’t want to spend money, I have also used &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; which is free and works just as well for what we’ll be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important part is having a place to host the files once they are generated. No more, no less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Web Browser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VSTS is browser-based, so get a your favourite modern browser, get it updated, and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code Editor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not going to be doing much code, but it’ll come in handy later on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I jump between &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt;. I’m sure you have your favourite, and that’ll do just fine for our purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You Forgot Visual Studio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No I didn’t. I don’t use Visual Studio, nor do we need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that I don’t like it, but it’s too heavy for the amount of coding I actually do for my blog. VSTS provides us with a web-based user interface that does everything we need for managing the source code, builds, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I don’t use Visual Studio here because I don’t need it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And We’re Ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with our toolbox of goodies and our project created, we’re good to go on starting to blog with VSTS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/11/How-to-Blog-with-VSTS-Part-2/&quot;&gt;Next up&lt;/a&gt;, we’ll starting with what is familiar and getting our code into VSTS. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Use Global NPM Packages on a VSTS Self-Hosted Build Agent]]></title><description><![CDATA[I took a couple of weeks off of blogging to focus on a building my presentation for Deliver.

In my spare time, I started tinkering with Visual Studio Team Services, where decided to start by automating the build and release of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My build script is pretty straight forward. Setup the global dependencies with NPM, setup the local dependencies with NPM, generate the content, and publish the generated assets. This worked in my hosted agent, but not my self-hosted agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a few solutions, but I’ll go through the one I selected for my build agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My build script would run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install --global hexo-cli&lt;/code&gt; and execute as expected. When the next step would try and use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hexo generate&lt;/code&gt; command, I would get the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;##[error]hexo : The term &amp;#39;hexo&amp;#39; is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check 
the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the install command was successful, the build script still couldn’t use the tool installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another symptom of this problem is that Team Services can’t see global NPM packages as common capabilities, such as Bower, Gulp, and Grunt.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I setup my build agent to use the NetworkService user account, but it could be setup for any user. The problem is that the NetworkService account can’t see the global packages on the machine after they are installed. The solution is to configure NPM to point to a folder that is visible to the NetworkService account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38570209/making-global-npm-packages-available-to-all-users-on-windows-2012-server&quot;&gt;this solution on StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; which lead me in the right direction, although I didn’t follow all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/prefix&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm prefix -g&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; command shows us path to global prefix folder, where the global npm packages are stored. We need to point this to a directory that NetworkService can read and execute. Generally speaking, the prefix folder is usually found in the user’s AppData folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change the prefix, run the command &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm config set prefix C:\\Path\\To\\Folder\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm&lt;/code&gt; which will change the npm prefix folder to be the one specified. Because I’ve set my build agent NetworkService account, I point it at the NetworkService account AppData npm folder for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then add the folder to the PATH variable for the machine. This will let VSTS see the npm packages as capabilities so that it knows that our build server can execute Grunt, Gulp, and Bower tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why Didn’t You Reset the Prefix?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense to reset the prefix to the previous value after the build has complete, as described in the StackOverflow solution. In my case, I wanted to make sure that if someone were logging into the build server to add another global package, let’s say something like Hexo CLI, then it would be installed in the appropriate directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t reset the prefix because I wanted to permanently configure the build agent. It’s a small build server that I’m using to experiment with continuous integration and deployment. If it’s good enough for StackOverflow then it’s good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Few Alternative Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative solution you could setup a new directory that isn’t the AppData folder, add the new folder to the PATH, and then point the prefix folder at build time. You could also leverage the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm bin&lt;/code&gt; setting and setup alias in your package.json file for the global commands you’re looking to use (Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaron-powell.com/&quot;&gt;Aaron Powell&lt;/a&gt; for providing me with that one), which is another good solution that I’ll revisit if I use something other than VSTS for builds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Windows Not Required - The New Microsoft Development Story (Video)]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is a recording of my recent Winnipeg .NET User Group talk about using Microsoft tools without requiring Windows.

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the most technical as I go over a ton of topics, at high level, ranging from development tools, to applications. Still, I find this stuff really interesting and hopefully you enjoy it too.&lt;/p&gt;

This blog post will ensure that not only I remember, but the entire Internet will remember the solution I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is simple: You pull down a repository that uses NPM for package management onto your Windows machine, you type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; and you get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm ERR! Failed at the &amp;lt;package&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;version&amp;gt; install script &amp;#39;node-gyp rebuild&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gyp ERR! stack Error: Can&amp;#39;t find Python executable &amp;quot;python&amp;quot;, you can set the PYTHON env variable.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the project you’re trying to build requires the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp&quot;&gt;node-gyp&lt;/a&gt; package to build something natively on the platform. That package required Python 2.7 and a few other pieces too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple problems sometimes get simple solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the node-gyp team, that is the case and they have documented it in the project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp&quot;&gt;README&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a &lt;em&gt;PowerShell&lt;/em&gt; CLI instance with administrative priviledges, and use the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; --global --production windows-build-tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a manual option as well, but I haven’t needed to use it as the first option always works for me.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Build ReactJS with Gulp]]></title><description><![CDATA[I wanted to play with ReactJS last week and figured I would just add another gulp talk to my build process, being that it’s all the rage…]]></description><link>https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/how-to-build-reactjs-with-gulp/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/how-to-build-reactjs-with-gulp/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:55:48 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to play with ReactJS last week and figured I would just add another gulp talk to my build process, being that it’s all the rage right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that it wasn’t that simple, as it turns out that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-react&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gulp-react&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been “deprecated in favor of gulp-babel”. I hadn’t planned on learning &lt;a href=&quot;http://babeljs.io/&quot;&gt;Babel&lt;/a&gt;, but it turns out it wasn’t very difficult once I was able to put all the pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find an extended version of the code in this post in my web project’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/dw-www/blob/master/gulpfile.js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gulpfile.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As of this writing, it can be found in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;feat/talks&lt;/code&gt; branch but should be merged into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/dw-blog&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; branch  soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Gulp Task&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the gulp task and I’ll walk you though it step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// packages &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; gulp        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;gulp&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	babel		&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;gulp-babel&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	sourcemaps	&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;gulp-sourcemaps&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// build all the JavaScript things&lt;/span&gt;
gulp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;build-script&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; src &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./src/script/*.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./src/components/*.jsx&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; gulp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;src&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sourcemaps&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;babel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
					presets&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
						&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;es2015&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
						&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
						&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
					&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;dw.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
				&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;gulp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;dest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./dist/script&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not overly complex, but there is a lot going on. Let me walk you though it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// packages&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; gulp        &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;gulp&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	babel		&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;gulp-babel&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	sourcemaps	&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;gulp-sourcemaps&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the packages I used in this solution. Here’s the breakdown in case you don’t feel like searching out each one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp&quot;&gt;gulp&lt;/a&gt; is the build tool itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-babel&quot;&gt;gulp-babel&lt;/a&gt; is the babel plugin that builds react for us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps&quot;&gt;gulp-sourcemaps&lt;/a&gt; is a pluging that generates sourcemaps for us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of unlisted packages that you’ll need as well. More specifically, the Babel preset packages. I use two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-es2015&quot;&gt;babel-preset-es2015&lt;/a&gt; because writing modern JavaScript is awesome and helps with writing ReactJS code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-react&quot;&gt;babel-preset-react&lt;/a&gt; which does the ReactJS stuff we need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: You don’t need the es2015 preset package, but you should use because you don’t hate yourself enough to write old JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things start simple with the declaration of my source files and kicking off the gulp pipe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; src &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./src/script/*.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./src/components/*.jsx&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; gulp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;src&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, I intialize the sourcemaps plugin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sourcemaps&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure what sourcemaps are, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/&quot;&gt;look them up&lt;/a&gt; as all the browser development tools support them and they made debugging transpiled code much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we leverage all the Babel things and do the actual transpilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;babel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
presets&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;es2015&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;react&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point were piping our source code into Babel, and it applies the preset &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/&quot;&gt;babel plugins&lt;/a&gt; for ES2015 and React. If you didn’t include the presets earlier, you would get an error at this point so make sure they’re installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we just write out our sourcemaps and our newly compiled JavaScript and JSX files to our output directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sourcemaps&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;.&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;gulp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;dest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./dist/script&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Et voila! Your gulp task transpiles your JSX and JS files. You can even use some &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/&quot;&gt;ES2015&lt;/a&gt; to boot.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Compile Typescript into a Single File with AMD Modules with Gulp]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’ve been tinkering with TypeScript lately and was trying to setup my project to compile all of my modules into a single file, which would…]]></description><link>https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/typescript-with-amd-and-gulp/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/typescript-with-amd-and-gulp/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2016 08:25:01 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been tinkering with TypeScript lately and was trying to setup my project to compile all of my modules into a single file, which would then be used in an HTML page. Maybe this is obvious to the more experienced TypeScript developer, but I had made a number of false assumptions while trying to get this to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will walk you through what I did to setup my build and get it working in an HTML page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can follow along at home with the source code which I’ve put up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/ts-project-template&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modular TypeScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project is starting out simple, with a single module and a couple of different “Apps” that will use the module. Module in TypeScript is extensively documented in the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;TypeScript Handbook&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re not familiar with this I would suggest reading up on it as it’s pretty awesome once you start using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, here’s my code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ModuleOne.ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ModuleOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sayHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello from Module1!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sayHelloTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;who&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; who&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;. This is Module1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// ModuleTwo.ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ModuleOne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sayHello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello from ModuleTwo!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sayHelloTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;who&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello &quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; who&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;. This is ModuleTwo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// App.ts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; Module1 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./modules/Module1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; Module2 &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./modules/Module2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;App&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; m1 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Module1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ModuleOne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; m2 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Module2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ModuleTwo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        
        m1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sayHelloTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;David Wesst&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        m2&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sayHelloTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;David Wesst&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a single application that is using two modules. Plain and simple. Next up, I compile my code into a single file, then reference that in my HTML, and done like dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--outFile&lt;/code&gt; Parameter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Reading through the doucmentation about TypeScript compilation, I found the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--outFile&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--out&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. I immediately assumed that I was done, as I would simple choose my ES target, select the type of modules I would like, and presto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; That wasn’t the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Being a person who likes modern JavaScript, I had originally opted to output ES6 compatible code complete with the new modules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This is was my first mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I found was that when I compiled, I would get a single output file but it would be completely blank. No error, but just an empty file. This is expected behaviour, as the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--outFile&lt;/code&gt; option only supports &lt;em&gt;commonjs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;amd&lt;/em&gt;. That meant no ES6 or even ES2015 modules for my project, which is probably for the best considering how few web browsers in the wild actually support ES6 modules as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In the end, I decided to go with AMD modules as I had some experience with &lt;a href=&quot;http://requirejs.org/&quot;&gt;RequireJS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Now, when I try to compile again it works as expected! One big JavaScript file ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; …sort of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using My Compiled TypeScript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the line, I assumed that whatever JavaScript file I compiled would only need me to add a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag reference to point to it like any other JavaScript file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my second mistake, albeit a pretty silly one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD modules have always needed RequireJS to load properly. That’s the purpose for RequireJS. Maybe I had assumed the TypeScript compiler would embed this library or something, but whatever my reasoning it was wrong. I needed to include a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-main&lt;/code&gt; file, as you do with every RequireJS example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added this to my HTML file, along with the RequireJS library in my project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;main&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;text/javascript&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;lib/require.js&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, my &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-main&lt;/code&gt; file goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// main.js&lt;/span&gt;
  
requirejs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    baseUrl&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;lib&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    paths&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;App&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;../app&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;requirejs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;App&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;MyApp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;starting application...&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; app &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;MyApp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;App&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    app&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to go into the details here, but my &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;paths&lt;/code&gt; object in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requirejs.config&lt;/code&gt; is pointing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; to our outputted file. We use this in our main function and point our compiled modules to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;MyApp&lt;/code&gt; object. We then call the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;start()&lt;/code&gt; function on our exported class and we are off to the races. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we run the application, we see the following in the JavaScript console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Details on Compilation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I skipped that part on purpose, because I don’t use the TSC compiler directly. Rather, I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ivogabe/gulp-typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gulp-typescript&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tsconfig&lt;/code&gt; file to compile my TypeScript and create sourcemaps for them. All of this is detailed on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-typescript&quot;&gt;package page&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ll include my gulp task to make sure you have all the details in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re welcome. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; tsProject &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; ts&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createProject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;tsconfig.json&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sourcemaps&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// using gulp-sourcemaps as prescribed by gulp-typescript&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;tsProject&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; tsResult
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;js
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sourcemaps&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;gulp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;dest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./dist&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;connect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// I use gulp-connect to watch and reload the page as I develop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here’s my &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt; file too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;outFile&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;app.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

The library has support for a riduculous number of languages, and provides theming capabilities, so it was the clear choice when it came to syntax highlighting for the web. The challenge is that tt’s not just adding simple script tag and you’re done with it. They seem to expect you to know what you’re doing when consuming the library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: this is a &lt;em&gt;good thing&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re only include code snippets for HTML and JavaScript, why would you want to bring down the stylesheets for D, Erlang, and ActionScript too? Same goes for the themes too. You’re likely going to pick a single theme and go with it, and not need all 77 they include. Because of the size of highlight.js, bringing it all down to the client would have a significant impact on your site’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky for us, the folks in charge of highlight.js have given us all the tools we need to make using the library in our application nice and performant. In my case, I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://bower.io&quot;&gt;Bower&lt;/a&gt; as my package manager and &lt;a href=&quot;http://gulpjs.com&quot;&gt;Gulp&lt;/a&gt; as my build system, which worked well once I figured out what I was doing. Let me walk you though it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing Highlight.js with Bower&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, you’ll need to add highlight.js to your project using Bower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;bower &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; --save highligh.js.origin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, after you install a package from Bower you have a ready-to-use JavaScript library. With highlight.js, this is not the case. Rather, you are left with source code ready to be built as you need it. To do that, we are going to use Gulp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building Highlight.js with Gulp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard work has already been done by the highlight.js team, as they have already included a lovely build tool for us to use. You can read about the details &lt;a href=&quot;http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building-testing.html&quot;&gt;here in the building and testing documentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to “building” highlight.js: the JavaScript and the stylesheets. We’ll be creating a task for each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building highlight.js JavaScript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the JavaScript component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building-testing.html&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; earlier, you know that there is a NodeJS script in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tools&lt;/code&gt; directory that will do all the heavy lifting. All we need to do in our Gulp task is use that script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my Gulp task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;gulp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;process-highlightjs-script&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; command &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;cd bower_components/highlight.js.origin&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; npm install&apos;&lt;/span&gt; 
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node tools/build :common&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;command&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;err&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; stdout&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; stderr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;stderr&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;stdout&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;err&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks a little strange for a gulp task, but all I’m doing is executing a shell command using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in NodeJS to spawn a child process. The important part is in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; variable. Let’s walk through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; bower_components/highlight.js.origin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I’m moving into the root directory of the highligh.js.origin package we previously installed using Bower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I’m installing the dependencies that are needed by the provided build tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;node tools/build :common&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’m running the build command as specified in the documentation. This part should be changed to make sure it includes the languages you want to display in your application. Details are in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building-testing.html&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest is just outputting the standard out and standard error streams to the console, and calling the Gulp callback to make sure we come back to our original process, as per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md#async-task-support&quot;&gt;Gulp documentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything is done correctly, you should have a new &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; folder in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;highlight.js.origin&lt;/code&gt; folder that contains your newly build library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building Highlight.js Themes for SASS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose this part is optional, but it shouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make optimize your site, you should be minimizing the number of requests that the client browser needs to make to get all the required resources for your application. For styling, that involves concatenanting all of your styles and style libraries into a single file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com&quot;&gt;SASS&lt;/a&gt; or, more specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass&quot;&gt;gulp-sass&lt;/a&gt; to build all of my stylesheets and combine them into a single CSS file as described by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-5&quot;&gt;SASS documentation&lt;/a&gt;. I’m going to assume that you’re doing the same, or at least something similar in your application that will be using highlight.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because SASS only handles combining other &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;scss&lt;/code&gt; files, I copy the theme stylesheet into a newly named &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;scss&lt;/code&gt; file. Here’s my gulp task for that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;gulp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;process-highlightjs-style&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; stylesheets &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./bower_components/highlight.js.origin/src/styles/atom-one-dark.css&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; gulp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;stylesheets&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;highlight.js.scss&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;gulp&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;dest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;./bower_components/highlight.js.origin/scss&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in my main stylesheet, I include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;scss&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-scss&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scss&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;@import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;../../bower_components/highlight.js.origin/scss/highlight.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will bring in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;highlight.js.scss&lt;/code&gt; file when I build my styles using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gulp-sass&lt;/code&gt; in my application stylesheet build task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now highlight.js ready to Use in our application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
    ![Highlight.js in Action](1cUniu9.png)
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Highlight.js in Action&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Caveat About Using Highlight.js with Markdown&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My post assumes that for any blocks of text where you want syntax highlighting you’re comfortable using the default &lt;a href=&quot;https://highlightjs.org/usage/&quot;&gt;highlight.js usage&lt;/a&gt; behaviour of wrapping the code with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I blog using Markdown, at the time of this writing I still wrap my text with these elements, unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/&quot;&gt;GitHub flavoured markdown&lt;/a&gt; that lets define the language using regular Markdown syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this, is that my blog engine renders the Markdown syntax with a bunch of extra HTML woven throughout the code to display it without the need for a library like highlight.js. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not be a big deal for you or your project, but I thought it was something you should be aware of when if you’re planning on using highlight.js in your application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mobile First Design Tips]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last weekend I released an updated version of my blog and website that share a similar design.

I decided to go with a mobile-first approach when it came to the design, which is a tried and tested way to create responsive web applications. Along the way, I tripped up and made a few mistakes that cost me some time and rework, but could have been easily corrected had I had these tips beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don’t Forget the Viewport meta tag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;viewport&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot about the first week of implementing my stylesheet. I won’t say that all my work was lost after adding it, but it certainly tossed all the detail I had put into the design implementation out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All modern designs have this header tag. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag&quot;&gt;read more about it on the MDN&lt;/a&gt; but, to summarize, it defines the width of your application viewport and the scale that it loads up in. Read through the section entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag#A_pixel_is_not_a_pixel&quot;&gt;A Pixel is Not a Pixel&lt;/a&gt; in the previous MDN article to get a better understand of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing to know is that without this, you will feel pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dev Tool Emulators are Your Friends&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edge, Chrome, Opera, Firefox, and Safari all have some kind of responsive design emulator tool to help make testing your code easy. Use it from the start, by selecting a pre-set responsive profile for the smallest device you care about for your web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t replace testing on an real small-screen device, but it definitely gets you moving on the development front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the built-in emulators from the get-go enforces the mobile-first approach by ensuring that you start with the minimal amount of screen real-estate when building your application. As I learned, it is easy to get caught up in adding extra content because you think you’ll have the space, which brings me to the next tip. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start without CSS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No really, start without any styling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder why, but it really helps with understanding what “content” you’re displaying. If you have a large number of elements on the screen that don’t actually convey any information, you are probably making your application less accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you have a lot of icons that are just there for asthetic purposes, you’ll notice them a lot more in the plain HTML version of your site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not using any CSS also helps with the next tip.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Show &lt;em&gt;ONLY&lt;/em&gt; The Bare Minimum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you work on a page or a view, make sure you know what the bare minimum amount of content can go on the page to make sure it is still usable. Being more of a usability problem, it might be up to your designer or user experience expert to solve this problem, but it’ll be up to you to develop and you’ll be responsible for “fixing” the page when it’s too cluttered if you don’t have this information up front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I wanted to display a list of blog posts. There is a lot of metadata for each post, but I needed to boil it down the bare minimum. From there, I was able to start placing the elements on screen and start sizing them. As I increased the screen size to test the responsiveness of my design, I added or changed the styling of certain elements to take advantage of the larger screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do you pick which screen sizes should be considered “larger”? There are so many devices with so many different screen sizes! &lt;em&gt;— You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great question (and segway) into my next tip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Steal Media Query Breakpoints&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although every project is a unique flower, at the end of the day the majority of our users are not. At least in the device sense. For this reason, I decided to start with the breakpoints &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities&quot;&gt;defined in Bootstrap 3&lt;/a&gt; and ended up using only a few them for what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a few of the queries defined &lt;a href=&quot;https://teamtreehouse.com/community/are-there-standard-media-query-break-points&quot;&gt;in this forum post&lt;/a&gt; which helped me get my simple, yet responsive, design working on extra small screens and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/*==========  Mobile First Method  ==========*/&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* Custom, iPhone Retina */&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token atrule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token rule&quot;&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; screen &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 320px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* Extra Small Devices, Phones */&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token atrule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token rule&quot;&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; screen &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 480px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* Small Devices, Tablets */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token atrule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token rule&quot;&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; screen &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 768px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* Medium Devices, Desktops */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token atrule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token rule&quot;&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; screen &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 992px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;/* Large Devices, Wide Screens */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token atrule&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token rule&quot;&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; screen &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;min-width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 1200px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

Although four months doesn’t seem like much of a hiatus, I learned very quickly that being a full time parent doesn’t leave much time to keeping my professional edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They might seem obvious, but it took me a while to find a balance to make sure spending time with my daughter &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; play second fiddle to my profession passion and/or obsession. I also didn’t want to give up the little bit of sleep I’ve managed to get, which bring me to the three things that really helped keep up up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/07/Keeping-Your-Edge-on-an-Extended-Break/office-daycare.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Late Night Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of nights where I was awake trying to calm down an unhappy baby, or just sitting there awake unable to sleep for whatever reason. Instead of just sitting there being alone with my frustration, I would pop in on earbud and listing to one of the many development podcasts (like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com/podcasts/&quot;&gt;WesternDevs podcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;hint hint&lt;/em&gt;) or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkDkgK59ygwHHMDSiW0M3-g&quot;&gt;Bithell Games podcast&lt;/a&gt; where they talk the business of video game development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the latter podcast isn’t my specialty, it is defintely something I am very interested and am able to draw parallels between regular software development and video game software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…which leads me to my next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Revisiting Hobby Projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have a million ideas, some of which have become abandoned repository in the bowels of GitHub or somewhere on our hard drives. Now that time is even more scarce, it makes sense to revisit some of these and see if there are any that can be broken down into very small parts that you can tinker with once and a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I redid my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/dw-www&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, started another new video game project, and upgraded the theme on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/dw-blog&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn’t just coding though, it involved some actual planning on my part where I looked at all the projects and found ones that could be broken up into small, bite-sized tasks which lead to a feeling of accomplishment when I acutally found time to work on something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helped keep my coding, but more importantly, it let me practice my software planning skills. Breaking projects down into small and consumable tasks, and deciding what is “good enough” for any project to be released is an important skill to have in the software development world. It’s especially difficult when you are your own client. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;User Groups and Online Meetups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re lucky enough to have a support system in place and have a babysitter willing to come by to give you a break for a few hours, you might want to check out whatever local user groups are in your area. If not, there are always events happening online that you can attend virtually complete with a chat window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was something I didn’t get to do a lot of, but when I did it was really nice. Meeting up with a community of like minded professionals and take a break from diapers and the like was really enjoyable and really helped keep me in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to get to my local .NET user group a few times, but I made a point to attend online conferences like &lt;a href=&quot;https://build.microsoft.com/&quot;&gt;\build&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://channel9.msdn.com/events/WebPlatformSummit/edgesummit2016&quot;&gt;Microsoft Edge Web Summit&lt;/a&gt; to keep myself in the loop and up-to-date. Plus, being an online streamed conference, the content ends up available on demand very shortly after it’s broadcasted just in case you have to stop watching early because of a grumpy baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post might be filled with obvious tips and tricks, but I wanted to take a moment to share. Balancing “real life” with your professional life can be challenging regardless of what is happening, and sometimes we need to take a break from our professional passions. Hopefully this post shows you that taking an extended break doesn’t mean you have to give up your professional edge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a CSS expert, this post probably isn’t for you. But for those of you who live inside of JavaScript most of the time, it might be a good refresher to see what other web platform tech can do for your sites and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;For the Enterprise Developers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to highlight that all of the features I’m talking about in this post are supported in IE9 and above. That wasn’t intentional, but I thought I’d share considering the enterprise doesn’t always have the latest and greatest browsers setup across their organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find more of that at &lt;a href=&quot;http://caniuse.com/&quot;&gt;CanIUse.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;REM (or Root EM) Units&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one doesn’t seem that cool, but it really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, people have used &lt;em&gt;em&lt;/em&gt; units to make sizing relative to the point value. So, if define a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;font-size: 16px&lt;/code&gt; in my root element, then 1em refers to 16px. Easy right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what if someone further along down the cascade of stylesheets decides to set their &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element to have a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;font-size: 24px&lt;/code&gt; because that’s how they’ve been doing fonts for the longest time. Now your &lt;em&gt;em&lt;/em&gt; units are changed, and 1em no longer means 16px, and everything is all fiddle-faddle-foo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;rem&lt;/em&gt; units, we’re always referencing the root point size. So, in our case, the original &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;font-size: 16px&lt;/code&gt; would always be used, even when our new developer adds a new &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/code&gt; rule to their stylesheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few CodePen examples from &lt;a href=&quot;https://j.eremy.net/confused-about-rem-and-em/&quot;&gt;Jeremy Church&lt;/a&gt; that capture em and rem very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the scoop on &lt;a href=&quot;http://caniuse.com/#feat=rem&quot;&gt;browser compatibility&lt;/a&gt; in case you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;REM Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-height=&quot;268&quot; data-theme-id=&quot;0&quot; data-slug-hash=&quot;qjEBs&quot; data-default-tab=&quot;result&quot; data-user=&quot;jeremychurch&quot; class=&apos;codepen&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;http://codepen.io/jeremychurch/pen/qjEBs/&apos;&gt;qjEBs&lt;/a&gt; by Jeremy Church (&lt;a href=&apos;http://codepen.io/jeremychurch&apos;&gt;@jeremychurch&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;http://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;EM Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-height=&quot;268&quot; data-theme-id=&quot;0&quot; data-slug-hash=&quot;AlxHk&quot; data-default-tab=&quot;result&quot; data-user=&quot;jeremychurch&quot; class=&apos;codepen&apos;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&apos;http://codepen.io/jeremychurch/pen/AlxHk/&apos;&gt;AlxHk&lt;/a&gt; by Jeremy Church (&lt;a href=&apos;http://codepen.io/jeremychurch&apos;&gt;@jeremychurch&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&apos;http://codepen.io&apos;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&quot;//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Viewport Units&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was new to me, and I like it quite a bit. Considering it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://caniuse.com/#feat=viewport-units&quot;&gt;supported&lt;/a&gt; across the board, I wish I had known about it sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viewport units are exactly what it sounds like— units of measure that represents a percentage of the height or width of the viewport. You get the option of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vh&lt;/code&gt; for viewport height, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vw&lt;/code&gt; for viewport width, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vmin&lt;/code&gt; for the smaller unit of either vh or vm, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;vmax&lt;/code&gt; for the larger of the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you have &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;height: 1vh&lt;/code&gt; then you’re setting the height to 1% of the viewport height. It doesn’t matter if your screen is 480px high, then it’s 4.8px. When you flip the phone around into landscape mode, the height changes, and so do the units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not sound like much, but it’s really helpful with things like typography. &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/&quot;&gt;CSS Tricks&lt;/a&gt; has a great example. Plus, if you want buttons or elements to consume a certain amount of your screen, this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a great solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;calc()&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are a few functions in CSS and this one is &lt;a href=&quot;http://caniuse.com/#feat=calc&quot;&gt;supported everywhere that matters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one lets you do unit calculations directly in your stylesheets. It might not sound like something you’d want to do, but it works really well when you want to position things in CSS dynamically. If you always want something 50px smaller than the 100% of the screen you can use  &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;height: calc(100% - 50px);&lt;/code&gt; and you’ll get the value you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, and handles both percentages and units. If you need something positioned or sized dynamically, this should save you the trouble of needing to use JavaScript to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/calc&quot;&gt;MDN page&lt;/a&gt; for the full details about &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;calc()&lt;/code&gt; and keep it in your back pocket.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Using text-overflow:ellipsis with Inline Flex]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dave Paquette, a fellow Western Dev, hit a strange CSS snag the other day.

He wanted to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;text-overflow: ellipsis&lt;/code&gt; on a flexbox item that displayed text, where the ellipsis would show up if the text was too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t work as expected, but after some digging, a solution was discovered. This post exists to document both the problem and solution with the hope that it prevents future headaches for other CSS developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His code went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;li span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; inline-flex&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.item span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 100px&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 1em&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;white-space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; nowrap&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; hidden&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;text-overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ellipsis&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to have all the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements line up, regardless of their contents. If their contents exceed the length of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; then should display an ellipsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, you get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset_img broken-result.png “Not quite right” %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have everything aligned, but no ellipsis. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this is the expected behaviour (see “But Why?” section below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to make sure that we apply the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;text-overflow&lt;/code&gt; property to a block element that lives inside a flex item. In our case, we need to wrap the text we want to have the ellipsis show up in a block element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The working code looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation attr-equals&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Icon&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Descriptive Text&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;margin-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 1em&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;white-space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; nowrap&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;.item span div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;overflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; hidden&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; we introduce is a block element that lives inside of the flex item. Now the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;text-overflow&lt;/code&gt; property applies, and all is good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;But Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll try and explain this, but be aware that I’m likely oversimplifying things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, this whole issue is expected behaviour. If you look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui/#text-overflow&quot;&gt;the spec&lt;/a&gt; for, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;text-overflow&lt;/code&gt; you find the definition you see in the quote below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This property specifies rendering when inline content overflows its line box edge in the inline progression direction of its block container element (“the block”) that has overflow other than visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;text-overflow&lt;/code&gt; isn’t meant to work on flex items, rather it is meant to work on block items as per the spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, so what? I mean, can’t the spec be adjusted to include &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;text-overflow&lt;/code&gt; on flex items? Although you would think it’s not a big deal to make this work for flex-items too, there are a number of considerations that need to be taken into account. More specifically, how flexbox works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that there really isn’t a clean way to do this. If you’re wondering how I came to that conclusion you can stop because I didn’t. Those responsible for the specification did, and you can read the full conversation that started with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=912434&quot;&gt;Mozilla bug report&lt;/a&gt; and leads to a whole &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Sep/0070.html&quot;&gt;mail group discussion&lt;/a&gt; about why it should (or, in this case, should not) be implemented as part of the spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you get &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;text-overflow&lt;/code&gt; working on flex items. You don’t. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[JavaScript Framework or JavaScript Core (Part 2)]]></title><description><![CDATA[A friend and I decided to make a video game using JavaScript.

&lt;p&gt;A friend and I decided to make a video game using JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deciding on whether or not to use a JavaScript game framework &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/finder-game&quot;&gt;I went with Phaser&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrinkus/walk&quot;&gt;Chris opted to go with pure JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were both right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series of posts, I want to explain how each of us answer the question: Should I use a JavaScript Framework or pure JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part 2 of 2 in the series. In this post, I’ll cover why I’ll cover why Chris opted not to use any frameworks and stick with pure JavaScript. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com/JavaScript/JavaScript-Framework-or-JavaScript-Core-Part-1/&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, I covered why I opted to use a JavaScript framework rather than pure JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Author’s Note&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I’m talking about game development frameworks, the concepts and rationale discussed in this series of posts can be applied to any project (game, business, or otherwise) on whether or not you should use a JavaScript framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Framing the Question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s frame this question in context to Chris’ goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like me, the game is a side project for Chris which means that it is important that he learn some new things along the way while still having the goal of “making a game”. We both had these general learning goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To learn how to draw using Canvas element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To learn more about “graphics” programming in JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To learn more about making games and game development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris, having less experience with JavaScript development than me, had the extra goal of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning more about JavaScript itself in the context of game development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last goal is different than mine, although I could have easily made this one of my goals too considering there is always more to learn when it comes to JavaScript. Still, it is a difference that I wanted to note as we’ll touch base on that near the end of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why use Pure JavaScript?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other side of the coin is to write your code from the ground up and rely on the native JavaScript APIs. In the case of Chris’ game, he wrote code against the Canvas API to draw to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, let’s begin with the reasons why this was a good decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Deeper understanding of the Specification&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming against the native API means that you’ll understand the specification that everyone shares, including all of the frameworks out there. With this core knowledge, you can gain a better understand on how to fix or improve the frameworks themselves for your games moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, you’ll understand more about why things happen the way they do than those who just consume a framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Better Performance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/02/JavaScript-Framework-or-Pure-JavaScript-P2/performance-graph.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning the native APIs means that you’re essentially programming “against the metal”, or as close as you can come to it when you talk about JavaScript. Assuming you’re writing efficient code, you are likely going to see some improved performance as compared to another game or application that is using a framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will also not have to worry about Fast Food Frameworks bloating and bogging down your application on the web, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://love2dev.com/#!article/Large-JavaScript-Frameworks-Are-Like-Fast-Food-Restaurants&quot;&gt;Chris Love&lt;/a&gt; would tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Understanding Your Full Stack&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you’re writing against the native API, you will end up knowing all of your code from top to bottom because you’ll have to write it all. This is an important consideration, as all software ends up with bugs. If you wrote all the code, then you’ll have a good idea of where to look when it comes to triage and implementing fixes, improvements, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, there are drawbacks to any solution. Let’s review a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lack of Support and Guidance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you select a framework, you’re relying on the experience of many other developers who have poured their knowledge into building that framework. Hypothetically, these developers wrote the framework to make something easier for their own projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you write all the code yourself, you rely on your own experience.That means if you don’t have experience with certain architecture, patterns, or practices you’re going to have to learn them quickly to figure out or possibly miss out on their benefits altogether because you simply don’t know what you don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Owning all the Code&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you own all of your code can be a bit of a double edged sword. Sure you own it all and ideally know it all inside out, but that means &lt;em&gt;you’re the only one&lt;/em&gt; that actually knows it. Anyone else looking at your code, whether to provide support or contribute, is going to have a steep learning curve and rely heavily on you to learn how your code works rather than some documentation provided by a community of developers already sharing a code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given, if you’re a solo developer, that might not be an issue. But even in that case, you might not be able to remember the exact details about why you wrote some code a certain way 6 months after you wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Productivity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any application, game or business apps, end up being made up of quite a bit of code to make sure all the features are implemented. Regardless of the benefits of owning all your code, the more code you have to write, the more time it’s going to take before you get something up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So What Should You Choose?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said before, Chris and I were both right in our respective decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that both of us can explain the “why” we made the decision without having to convince ourselves that we were correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your next project, you should choose what makes sense for you and your project goals. If you’re looking to produce something as quickly as possible, it’s probably best to pick a framework that can help you get moving faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to learn or explore something new and need (or want) to know how the insides work, it’s probably best to learn from the native APIs upwards, or possibly clone a framework and start modifying for your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, if you ask yourself “why” you made the decision to go one way or the other and find that you need to convince yourself that you made the right decision, maybe it’s time to rethink that choice before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[JavaScript Framework or JavaScript Core (Part 1)]]></title><description><![CDATA[A friend and I decided to make a video game using JavaScript.

&lt;p&gt;A friend and I decided to make a video game using JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deciding on whether or not to use a JavaScript game framework &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/finder-game&quot;&gt;I went with Phaser&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrinkus/walk&quot;&gt;Chris opted to go with pure JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were both right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series of posts, I want to explain how each of us answer the question: Should I use a JavaScript Framework or pure JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part 1 of 2 in the series. In this post, I’ll cover why I opted to use a JavaScript framework rather than pure JavaScript. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/02/JavaScript-Framework-or-Pure-JavaScript-P2&quot;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll cover why Chris opted not to use any frameworks and stick with pure JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Author’s Note&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I’m talking about game development frameworks, the concepts and rationale discussed in this series of posts can be applied to any project (game, business, or otherwise) on whether or not you should use a JavaScript framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Framing the Question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand my decision, you should understand my goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a side project, I always make sure that I am learning something new along the way. Chris has the same perspective, outside of “making a game” we both have these learning goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To learn how to draw using Canvas element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To learn more about “graphics” programming in JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To learn more about making games and game development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me, being a professional application developer, I also had the goal of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning to apply my application development skills to the game development world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last goal is really important to me and is framed as a goal rather than a problem. Everything I understand about game development demonstrates that it’s quite different from regular application development. In the past, I’ve gotten stuck thinking of a game like it’s a regular application. Hopefully with this goal in mind, I’ll be able to push through my tendency to build an app rather than a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why use a JavaScript Framework?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the path I took for my project: to learn a new JavaScript framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the good stuff, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Simplification&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A framework provides an abstraction over the native API’s provided by JavaScript, which &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; simplify things a little. For example, when it comes to drawing on a canvas, I create the objects that I want and give them to the engine, and voilà, they are drawn. I don’t need to worry about the specifics on how it actually draws it, which allows me to focus on things like architecture and how to leverage the game loop itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Guidance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being new to game development, the framework provides me guidance on how to build a game rather than a business application. This has helped me immensely, as it’s forced me to use a game loop and a game object hierarchy, which has helped me learn how a game works differently than a regular JavaScript application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Support Network &amp;#x26; Productivity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/02/JavaScript-Framework-or-Pure-JavaScript-P1/network.png&quot; alt=&quot;network&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any popular framework, you’re going to get other experts who have already implemented things with the framework. This way, I’m not re-inventing the wheel when it comes to finding a way to implement a feature. Rather, I can learn from what others have asked, done, and documented, and apply that to my game quickly, rather than having to come up with my own solution every time something comes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, if there is an issue with one of the many functions of the framework, the community can rally behind it and push out a fix rather than just having myself to rely on for fixing any and all issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all that good, there are some shortcomings that I should note alongside the pros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Framework Lifespan&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/02/JavaScript-Framework-or-Pure-JavaScript-P1/dead-framework.png&quot; alt=&quot;dead-framework&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, there are plenty of flavours of whatever framework you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every Phaser, there are at least another dozen frameworks that do the same thing, just in a different way. When it comes to picking one, there is a good chance that in a few years (or a few months in some cases) all my knowledge of the framework will be deprecated knowledge as the industry will have moved to the “next new thing”, along with the support network I mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Performance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard the term “Fast Food frameworks” for the first time from &lt;a href=&quot;http://love2dev.com/#!article/Large-JavaScript-Frameworks-Are-Like-Fast-Food-Restaurants&quot;&gt;Chris Love&lt;/a&gt;. Now that I’ve gone with Phaser, my game now requires this framework to run, and its performance and compatibility with different platforms is dependent on the framework. So far, I have no issues, but as things get more complicated, I could find myself tightly coupled to the performance limitations of the framework, whatever they may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, even though I’m not using all of the parts of Phaser, I’ll need to include the whole library, which can lead to slower load times, especially when we’re talking about playing the game on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To Summarize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my needs, a framework allows me to focus on learning the higher level concepts of game development while applying my existing JavaScript and application developments. The framework also keeps me within the game development paradigm by means of forcing me down a certain implementation path (i.e. using the Phaser game loop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that being said, there are still great reasons not to use a JavaScript framework. We’ll cover that in part 2 of this series.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Exploring JavaScript Game Frameworks]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last month I explored a number of JavaScript-based game frameworks in an attempt to pick the perfect one for my first game.

&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d take a moment to share four of them that really stood out to me, along with a few honerable mentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; that I’ve left a bunch off the list, as that is the nature of a “top X” list. If I missed your favourite one, then feel free to let me know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Phaser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/02/Exploring-JavaScript-Game-Frameworks/phaser.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll start with the one I picked for my game. &lt;a href=&quot;http://phaser.io/&quot;&gt;Phaser&lt;/a&gt;, developed by Richard Davey (a.k.a. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/photonstorm&quot;&gt;@PhotonStorm&lt;/a&gt;) is an open source JavaScript game framework for desktop and mobile games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Adventures-in-Phaser-with-TypeScript-tutorial-series.aspx&quot;&gt;the Phaser tutorial from GameFromScratch.com&lt;/a&gt;, here’s what I liked about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s just a framework, plain and simple. No special IDE or engines needed, just code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; and widely used, and has a strong community surrounding it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s stable, mature, and actively developed for a JavaScript framework. Currently at vervsion 2.4.4 at the time of writing, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://phaser.io/labs&quot;&gt;v3 in the works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really drew me towards Phaser was it’s well documented API, and the numerous tutorials and examples from the community. Even though I’m just starting out, every feature that I’ve looked to implement appears to have been at least partially implemented and documented in a tutorial, making the learning curve much less steep than it could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check it out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Superpowers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/02/Exploring-JavaScript-Game-Frameworks/superpowers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://superpowers-html5.com/index.en.html&quot;&gt;Superpowers&lt;/a&gt; one has a lot of potential. Seeing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sparklinlabs.itch.io/discover-superpowers&quot;&gt;game demo&lt;/a&gt; they made really gave me all the proof I needed believe in what they’re doing over there at Sparklin Labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the highlights that stood out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Totally &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;, as in the engine and the tooling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toolset is a browser-based IDE for game development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typescriptlang.org/&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;, giving you the power of JavaScript with some extras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only drawback I found was that it was really new when I was shopping for a game framework, which means that it’s more on the bleeding edge than the cutting edge IMHO. Still, this is one I’ll be watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in learning how to leverage Superpowers, I suggest checking out their &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.superpowers-html5.com/en/getting-started/about-superpowers&quot;&gt;documentation site&lt;/a&gt; or this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2016/02/01/Superpowers-Tutorial-Series-Part-One-Getting-Started.aspx&quot;&gt;GameFromScratch.com tutorial series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PlayCanvas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/02/Exploring-JavaScript-Game-Frameworks/playcanvas.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://playcanvas.com/&quot;&gt;PlayCanvas&lt;/a&gt; when I bought a Humble Bundle focused around game development tools. PlayCanvas seems to be cut from the same cloth as SuperPowers, but is a bit more mature considering it’s been around longer. It focuses more on 3D content, although I’m sure you could do 2D content just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what made PlayCanvas interesting to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engine is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/playcanvas/engine&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;, but tooling is not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tooling runs in-browser, making it accessible to any development platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tooling was very easy to use, and I was able to start for free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PlayCanvas really reminded me the &lt;a href=&quot;https://unity3d.com/&quot;&gt;Unity3D&lt;/a&gt; toolset, which is widely used in the industry. Given, the value is really in the tooling, which isn’t open source. Still, it might be worth checking out if you are looking for a toolset to go with your game engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2015/04/19/A-Closer-Look-at-the-PlayCanvas-Game-Engine.aspx&quot;&gt;GameFromScratch tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that helped me get things moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Haxe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/02/Exploring-JavaScript-Game-Frameworks/haxe.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://haxe.org/&quot;&gt;Haxe&lt;/a&gt; really isn’t JavaScript, but it’s very similar to it and supports web development, so I’m including it. Plus, it really did stand out as a viable option to me when picking my game for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s a language/toolkit that focuses on game / rich UI development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very mature and has plenty of support around it for whatever games you’d like to develop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the cornerstone of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://haxe.org/foundation/&quot;&gt;Haxe Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When targetting JavaScript, you can leverage other JavaScript libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haxe is something that I keep coming across in my adventures with game development, and one day I’ll head back and learn more about it. Just need to find the right project, and feel a bit more comfortable with game development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can checkout the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe&quot;&gt;source code here&lt;/a&gt; but I’d suggest exploring &lt;a href=&quot;http://haxe.org/&quot;&gt;the website&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Honorable Mentions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close things out, I wanted to highlight a few other frameworks and toolsets that I thought were pretty cool but wasn’t what I was looking for with my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://babylonjs.com/&quot;&gt;BabylonJS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://threejs.org/&quot;&gt;ThreeJS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pixijs.com/&quot;&gt;PixiJS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I missed your favourite (which I’m sure I did) you should drop it in the comment section and share your favourite library and/or toolset.

This isn’t a post about why Microsoft having more open source software (OSS) processes and projects is important, or how it is “amazing” that they are turning a new leaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post answers the question that I don’t see people asking: &lt;em&gt;why is having a OSS JavaScript engine important to anyone&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you already know the answer to this, or maybe you’re just too shy to ask, but I’m going to take a moment and try and give you some idea about why ChakraCore being open source is really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be the most important point for me, as NodeJS is my development platform of choice. For the first time in the history of NodeJS, there is an alternative to the V8 JavaScript engine that has been built into NodeJS from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no problems with V8. It’s done well by me, considering without it we likely wouldn’t have NodeJS at all. But having a different option provides more flexibility to the developer. Maybe Chakra can run faster than V8 when it comes to certain tasks, or maybe it can provide more JavaScript features that you want to use for your project. Now you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; change Node’s engine, which means all kinds of opportunity for NodeJS developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, if you can change NodeJS to use ChakraCore, then why couldn’t you sub in another engine like &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey&quot;&gt;SpiderMonkey&lt;/a&gt; or something else. It leads to more options, which leads to competition, and that is always healthy in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Community Support and Pull Requests&lt;/h3&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no! Not another security gap in all the browsers! What ever will we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, the only solution would have been to wait for an official release from the Microsoft team, hoping that they had all the details they needed. Now, the team can work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the community directly and publically so that we know where things are at. If there is a security gap reported, people can find it, report it, &lt;em&gt;and fix it&lt;/em&gt; by submitting a pull request directly to the team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, my browser can sleep comfortably at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Knowing How the Sausage is Made&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/1bfDB3YPHFI&quot;&gt;YouTube announcement&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft has decided to bet big on JavaScript as a whole which is why building a brand new JavaScript engine made sense for the business. Although it was clearly a huge improvement over Trident, we still didn’t know what was going into the engine and what made it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can see how the engine actually works. No secret sauce, no magic, just code. This is great for people looking to use a JavaScript on sensitive projects, or in highly secure environments that require knowing all the insides and outs to a system before it can be considered. In those cases you can fork the project, make some changes for your environment, and continue to get support from the original team by merging their changes as they publish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript engines are a very specific tool, but if your application needs a scripting component or you need to interpret JavaScript directly, you’re in luck because ChakraCore is out in the wild now. Fully supported by Microsoft, and is meant to be integrated with other software, it’s a really great option for those that can use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, if you don’t like how IE or Edge is running your JavaScript, you can get to the bottom of the problem yourself and submit a pull request. No more hiding behind the curtain. Developers have information they need to provide direct feedback on how Edge can run better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time, I think we’ll see more than just NodeJS, but rather Chakra become the heart of a lot of cool projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m thinking of using it as an on-the-fly scripting engine where a game object has a script that needs to be interpreted during game play, like AI or some sort of behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now I’ll probably start with getting it working on my Raspberry Pi. I have one sitting on my desk and I’m itching to get something cool working on it. Either way, I’ll probably start with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.windows.com/en-us/iot&quot;&gt;Windows 10 IoT&lt;/a&gt; page for some ideas, or take a stab at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/wiki/Embedding-ChakraCore&quot;&gt;embedding it into a project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;20-Jan-2016 UPDATE: Pull Request Submitted&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you’re interested, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4765&quot;&gt;Microsoft has submitted a pull request to the NodeJS project&lt;/a&gt; to enable NodeJS to run with the ChakraCore engine. As I mentioned before: we can see how things are moving along publically because it’s open source. No magic, just code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/41q8h2/why_chakracore_oss_is_important/&quot;&gt;CaptainIncredible from Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and the other commenters out there for taking the time to do the proofreading that I so desperately should have done before publishing.

&lt;p&gt;This is the spiritual sequel to my previous {% post_link 2016-01-01-Highlight-Reel-for-2015 “Highlight Reel for 2015” %} post. You don’t need to read it previously, but it might provide some context on some of these ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that with everything still in flux and forever changing, it’s easier for me to list out the interests and ideas, rather than concrete requirements for individual projects. Not sure how they’ll pan out exactly, but here’s the “what, why, and how” for the plan for 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Focus My Content&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What?&lt;/strong&gt; Any content I produce, (e.g. blog posts, YouTube videos, presentations, etc…) should be able to be categorized into one of three categories: JavaScript App Dev (Primary), JavaScript Game Dev (Secondary), Gaming (Personal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt; When I go back through my blog, it feels a little too unstructured. As in, the author knows lots of stuff, but appears to be all over the place with his content. Maybe that’s what people’s blogs tend to be, but I’d like to focus my efforts and see if writing content in a focused way leads me into something of a specialty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How?&lt;/strong&gt; The three categories listed above should act as a sort of guide before I spend time working on new content. Plus, it should allow me to plan what I’m going to write about and not about just writing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Talk About Today&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What?&lt;/strong&gt; Might seem obvious, but I should be talking about what I am working on topics that I’m not familiar with, but seem to be trending or something that I want to learn “for the next project”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt; In order to get involved with conferences or to force myself to learn new subject, I would sometimes volunteer content for conferences or events on subjects that I wasn’t all too familiar with. It only resulted in stress and generally content that I wouldn’t call my best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How?&lt;/strong&gt; When I’m working on a project, I hope to factor in some time to generate content that relates the part of the project I’m working on. For example, if I’m spending time setting up a build script for a project, document what I’m doing in blog posts or slide deck for a presentation. I could possibly review it and screen capture the steps and turn it into a series of YouTube videos. Either way, it’ll involve some premeditation on my part and possibly slow down “progress”, but I think that in time it’ll become a great way to document what I’m learning, as I’m learning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Get Back to Games&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What?&lt;/strong&gt; I really love video games. It’s a passion of mine, and I’d like to get back into sharing that side of me with the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt; I think adding something a bit more personal to my online presence will add some personality to my content. I don’t want to pollute the content I produce, so I’ll have to do it in a smart way. Still, I think it’s important to keep passion as part of what I think about and share with everyone. Maybe it’ll inspire me with new ideas or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How?&lt;/strong&gt; Carefully and cautiously. As I said, I don’t want to pollute my content stream with a bunch of random video game posts. Hopefully one of my planned projects comes together and I’ll have a way for people to filter out that content as necessary. But again, we’ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Become a Producer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What?&lt;/strong&gt; If I want to get structured and scheduled with my content, I need to start thinking like a producer and plan out what I will be making regardless of what it is. I plan out what the content is, schedule when it’s going to get created, edited, and released, and ensure that time is available to actually make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt; I like sharing content, not only for some kind of self indulgence, but because it forces me to think about what I’ve learned and ensures that I won’t lose the knowledge, and that I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; understand it. To make sure that I stay on track and that the content continues to fit into everything else I’d like to accomplish in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How?&lt;/strong&gt; After this post, I’m going to spend some time planning out content for the year. Planning will start with looking at my projects, determining what topics I can generate content from, and what it will cost with respect to time, to generate that content. If I have more time one month, I might plan on some richer content like videos or some other ideas I have mulling around in my brain. If not, I can rely on my blogging skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the previous post, this is more for me than it is for the audience. It is a concrete representation of my reflection on the year gone by, and how I can take the lessons learned and use them moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what I can do with the upcoming year. I’ll probably blog about the results in 365 days…or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing. ~ DW &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Highlight Reel for 2015]]></title><description><![CDATA[{% img http://blog.davidwesst.com/2016/01/Highlight-Reel-for-2015/thinker.png %} I just finished reading my post about 2014.

&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading my &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/01/Highlight-Reel-for-2014/&quot;&gt;post about 2014&lt;/a&gt;. If I were to compare my plans for 2015 to the result of the year-long sprint, I’d have to say that it appears that we are either way off track, or that the requirements have changed quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 has been great, with all sorts of chaos thrown throughout. In this post I’ll share with you the highlights and the lessons learned from those events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Real Life Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after my 2014 post, I was laid off from my position as a Systems Analyst and found out that my partner and I were finally going to have a baby. In short, my life changed dramatically throughout the year. Different income levels, new responsibilities, and just a different outlook on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I wrote that original post, I was sure that having six months to finish off all my projects was going to be plenty. But, as I mentioned before, requirements change with priorities, and with the lay off, combined with the pressure of potentially not having employment to support my larger family, resulted in plenty of non-productive days and a shift in task priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Lesson 1: Personal Time is a Limited&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds lame, but it’s true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you continue to grow as a person, you tend to take on new responsibilities, and those take up more of your personal time. Whether its a new job, or a kid, or a new house or investment. Personal time to commit to one or more of these projects is limited, so make sure that when you have the time, you’re ready to jump on it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ZVGQ Soft Launch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March I thought I had done enough to get an early release of ZVGQ, the five (now six) year long project out the door. I launched it, announced it, and started getting things moving on the site. And then it became too much to maintain, development came to a halt, and I realized the soft launch was a bust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t say I had failed on the task execution, but rather the planning side. I underestimated what it takes to build &lt;em&gt;and maintain&lt;/em&gt; a software project, which lead the launch to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Lesson 2: Maintenance Plans are Important&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d think I would have known this being a software analyst for years in both the public and private sectors. I know that I’ve created maintenance plans for many projects before we even started writing a single line of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that for my &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; software, I tend to think like a client. I’m exempt from the rules, because it’ll cost too much or whatever reason. That is where things went wrong. I cut corners to make get system live, but I didn’t consider what it was going to take to maintain AND build the software in parallel. It was doable for a while, but when the real life changes started to crop up in the middle of the year, it just became too much and it slipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on about this, but I’ll save it for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Job and Western Devs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the lay off period, my employer found a new position for me as an Application Developer, which translates to roughly an Intermediate Software Developer that focuses primarily on Java-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as this was coming together, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com&quot;&gt;Western Devs&lt;/a&gt; were starting to get organized and asking who would be interested in contributing to a community driven site filled with content from any of us willing to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a part of the Western Devs community and getting back into code trenches has made me realize something:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Lesson 3: Learning New Stuff Makes it Interesting&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 70 JUnit test written, 25 blog posts, and a handful of podcasts, I’ve relearned that the reason I love programming so much is because I’m forever going to be learning. Whether it’s design principles, new methodologies, or new tools and technologies, all of it is learning and that makes it interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to my side projects, it’s important that I work on things that  &lt;em&gt;I want&lt;/em&gt; to build. To keep things interesting, I need to be learning something new continually. That way I keep myself interested in the project and don’t just jump to the next one because it has something cool to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No point other than to take a moment to self-reflect and produce a concrete representation of that self-reflection. Next post will be about what I plan to do with what I’ve taken away from 2015 and Looking-Forward-into-2016 “how I will take that forward into 2016”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sort of conclusion, of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m back from the summit and have had a week to digest everything I saw. And now I will share with the top three topics that really stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Visual Studio Team Services and ALM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I bet you didn’t think you’d read about VSO, err..I mean, VS Team Services on my blog, but you are. I’m just as surprised as you are; trust me. Why put this big, bloated piece of software on my list? Because I got to see it working with NodeJS and JVM-based projects and I have to say, what I saw was really impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/11/Inspiration-from-MVP-Summit-2015/vso.png&quot; alt=&quot;vso.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, it’s not perfect. It still lacks SSH support (but it’s coming soon) and I’m still not 100% about why work items need to be so customizable, but it really is powerful toolset that starts you off at the right price at $0 for unlimited private repositories, and even some cloud-based build server time. The build tool is pretty cool and supports all kinds of JavaScript and Java-based systems, which really appeals to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the skills I lack on my resume is a strong understanding of Application Lifecycle Management, or ALM for short. Although I know there are plenty of tools out there, VSTS gives me everything I need for free, with some great tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did they convince me to look open up my copy of Visual Studio 2015? No. No they didn’t. That is staying off, but VSTS is a great stepping stone for me and it might be for you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vorlon.JS is Open Sorcery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No really, it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/11/Inspiration-from-MVP-Summit-2015/vorlon.png&quot; alt=&quot;vorlon.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can triage any client-side JavaScript application from anywhere in the world by simply having the device running the application load up a page on your Vorlon server. Or, if you’re looking to triage someone else’s work, you can use the Vorlon proxy feature to load up any site and start going through the guts to see how it can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing, and I’m not talking more about it until I get to talk about it in depth once I get my hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I say that it’s open source? ‘Cause it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;JavaScript is Stronger Than Ever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With both ES5 and ES6 out the door, it’s time to look to the future of JavaScript and where it will be going with ES7, and that’s exactly what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/11/Inspiration-from-MVP-Summit-2015/es7.png&quot; alt=&quot;es7.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of stuff to get excited about, but my personal favourites are &lt;a href=&quot;https://tc39.github.io/ecmascript-asyncawait/&quot;&gt;async functions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jeffmo/es-class-static-properties-and-fields&quot;&gt;class properties&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tc39/Array.prototype.includes&quot;&gt;Array.prototype.includes&lt;/a&gt;, and String &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tc39/proposal-string-pad-left-right&quot;&gt;padding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-string-left-right-trim&quot;&gt;trimming&lt;/a&gt; functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out. Really, it’s going to be cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Universal Windows Platform, from Raspberry Pi to Web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/07/06/project-westminster-in-a-nutshell/&quot;&gt;Project Westminster&lt;/a&gt; is really cool. An easy way to bring your web code to a local device, but with UWP your code now works on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; Windows 10 device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/11/Inspiration-from-MVP-Summit-2015/node-installer.png&quot; alt=&quot;node-installer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/node-uwp&quot;&gt;NodeJS supporting UWP&lt;/a&gt;, me and my JavaScript code are set for pretty much anything. Oh, and I can run my NodeJS UWP application on a Raspberry Pi. That’s just nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is I’m inspired to keep on JavaScriptin’ and I hope you find something in my list of cool things from MVP summit to get your brain moving.&lt;/p&gt;

So entire development suites like Cloud9 or Visual Studio Online are off the table because they are full tool suites. These tools are simple, but continually help me out in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to share your favourite tools in the comments below so I can learn and grow from your knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jsonlint.com&quot;&gt;JSONLint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/jsonlint.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/jsonlint.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks, I’ve been writing and debugging a REST API client written in Java, where my POJO is being serialized into JSON and sent off in a request. I hit a few bugs where the JSON that was being generated wasn’t 100% valid. This made validating it easy, and I keep it open whenever I’m dealing with any JSON that isn’t continually being edited in VS Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I missed that there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://pro.jsonlint.com/&quot;&gt;pro.jsonlint.com&lt;/a&gt; which provides a diff function. This would have saved me a ton of time, had I read the description provided on the main page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regexr.com/&quot;&gt;Regexr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/regexr.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/regexr.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a JavaScript person, you’d think I’d be a pro with regular expressions. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://regexr.com&quot;&gt;Regexr.com&lt;/a&gt; I can at least appear to be. Between the reference guide on the left side, real-time match highlighting, I really like this tool and it has made learning and using regexes in my day-to-day very easy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, the slick design doesn’t hurt either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hex.colorrrs.com/&quot;&gt;Colorrrs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/colorrrs.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/colorrrs.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other HEX to RGB converters out there, I know. I just really like this one because it gives me a full screen preview of the colour I’m look at, and it’s a pretty website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like pretty websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://smartviewapp.com/&quot;&gt;SmartView&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/smartviewapp.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/smartviewapp.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re getting into the protein part of our meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve used Trello in the past, and generally end up ditching the project boards because I’m not a Kanban or Agile professional. Lucky for me, my fellow Western Dev &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com/bios/amir_barylko/&quot;&gt;Amir Barylko&lt;/a&gt; is a professional and has used is expertise to guide me along the path and provides me with some metrics on my throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They start you off with a free account, which is where I began for a personal kanban for coordinating my side project efforts for myself. I suggest you check it out and get productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Disclosure&lt;/strong&gt;:  As mentioned above, Amir is a colleague of mine and I do support his work. That being said, I wouldn’t have added it to my list if I didn’t use it as much as I do, or if I found it as useful as it really is.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/explore&quot;&gt;GitHub Explore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Gists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/github-gist.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/My-Favourite-Online-Dev-Tools/github-gist.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/explore&quot;&gt;GitHub Explore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Gists&lt;/a&gt; to explore and find code that can help guide me through solving problems, or by finding open source software and/or libraries that can help solve a problem for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why re-invent the wheel when someone else has lead a team to and refined a solution to your problem already? At the very least, you can learn from their code and figure out how it applies to you’re trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing. ~ DW&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Using Java Build Script Tasks in Visual Studio Code]]></title><description><![CDATA[I previously shared how I setup a custom problem matching in Visual Studio Code for compiling Java  and displaying the errors inline with a…]]></description><link>https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/using-java-build-script-tasks-in-visual-studio-code/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/using-java-build-script-tasks-in-visual-studio-code/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2015 08:18:19 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com/custom-tasks-for-java-in-visual-studio-code/&quot;&gt;previously shared&lt;/a&gt; how I setup a custom problem matching in Visual Studio Code for compiling Java  and displaying the errors inline with a custom problem matcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortcoming with &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks&quot;&gt;Tasks&lt;/a&gt; was that you could only define one, which is (in my humble opinion) by design to help developers by forcing them to create a build script rather than setting up tasks, as a build script is not coupled to the IDE and can be used elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code has support for build systems like Grunt, Gulp, and Jake, but what if we want to handle something totally different, like use Gradle on a Java project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you do that? Good question. Let me show you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Define a Build Script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve setup a standard Gradle project by using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gradle init&lt;/code&gt; and created a class with a main method named &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;HelloLink&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/hellolink-file.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/hellolink-file.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, I want to create a custom build task. We’ll call our task &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;getSword&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/gradle-project.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/gradle-project.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we need to do the fun part: hook it into Code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Add a Task to VS Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take a page out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Custom-Tasks-for-Java-in-Visual-Studio-Code/&quot;&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we need so to setup our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tasks.json&lt;/code&gt; file. Do that by pressing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Ctrl + Shift + P&lt;/code&gt; and searching for “task” and select for &lt;em&gt;Configure Task Runner&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s add gradle as our task, which should leave our tasks file looking like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/gradle-task.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/gradle-task.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we run it, by pressing &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Ctrl + P&lt;/code&gt; and entering &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;task gradle&lt;/code&gt; we should get the output window displaying our gradle command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/gradle-task-output.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/gradle-task-output.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we’re back to where we started, but gradle (like any build system) has way more tasks than just my custom one. How do I gain access to those?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple: you add tasks to your gradle task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding a Task to your Task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t already seen it, you have intellisense while you’re editing your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tasks.json&lt;/code&gt;. If you browse through the multitude of JSON properties, you’ll find one called &lt;em&gt;tasks&lt;/em&gt; which is where we can define our gradle specific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/tasks-intellisense.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/tasks-intellisense.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We define, what I call a subtask, just like we do a regular task, except the JSON schema is a little different. After adding a task for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;getSword&lt;/code&gt; and , my tasks file now looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
{
“version”: “0.1.0”,
“command”: “gradle”,
“isShellCommand”: true,
“args”: [],	// no args, but we could add some
“tasks”: [
{
“taskName”: “getSword”,
“showOutput”: “always”,
“echoCommand”: true
}
]
}
{% endcodeblock %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, but so far we haven’t done anything actually useful. Let’s apply what we’ve learned here and from &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Custom-Tasks-for-Java-in-Visual-Studio-Code/&quot;&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt; and get a useful command setup in Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doing Something Real&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, not only do we want a task to call custom tasks, but we’ll probably want one to compile and run our Java too. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html&quot;&gt;gradle application&lt;/a&gt; provides us with a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; command that we’ll call as our default build command, which will give us the &lt;em&gt;F5&lt;/em&gt; experience we know from our big, bloated, buddy, Visual Studio proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like we did with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;javac&lt;/code&gt; command, we need to add a problem matcher to our task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tasks file now looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
{
“version”: “0.1.0”,
“command”: “gradle”,
“isShellCommand”: true,
“args”: [&quot;&quot;],
“tasks”: [
{
“taskName”: “getSword”,
“showOutput”: “always”,
“echoCommand”: true
},
{
“taskName”: “run”,
“showOutput”: “silent”,
“isBuildCommand”: true,
“problemMatcher”: {
“owner”: “external”,
“fileLocation”: “absolute”,
“pattern”: [
{
“regexp”: ”^(.+\.java):(\d):(?:\s+(error)):(?:\s+(.*))$”,
“file”: 1,
“location”: 2,
“severity”: 3,
“message”: 4,
“loop”: true	// add this to loop through multiple lines
}
]
}
}
]
}
{% endcodeblock %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you run it, you should get an error in our source code. Press &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Ctrl + Shift + M&lt;/code&gt; to see the warning about our static method, and click it to go to the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/gradle-error.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/gradle-error.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you probably noticed, we set our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; task, we’ve set it to be the &lt;em&gt;Build Command&lt;/em&gt; so that when we hit &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Ctrl + Shift + B&lt;/code&gt; it will execute our command. So, once we go and fix our application we can run it with a keyboard shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can open up your output window by hitting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Ctrl + Shift + U&lt;/code&gt; and see our application in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/complete.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Using-Java-Build-Script-Tasks-in-Visual-Studio-Code/complete.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one simple example using Gradle, but you could use Maven or Ant, or whatever custom build script tool you want, assuming it has a command line response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other things you can configure with tasks, including the OS-specific commands that need to be executed. Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks_appendix&quot;&gt;JSON Schema&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

Now I worry about opening another instance of Eclipse. Don’t get me wrong, Visual Studio and Eclipse are both great tools, but there are plenty of times where I don’t need to bring a forklift just to move a single box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I love Visual Studio Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, we don’t have native rich support for Java in Code. We &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have syntax and bracket matching for Java, I wanted to see if I could compile and possibly display any errors directly in code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do that using &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks&quot;&gt;Tasks&lt;/a&gt;, and here’s what I did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configure a Task Runner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start you need a task runner for your project, which is where you will…you guessed it…configure tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Ctrl + Shift + P&lt;/code&gt; to bring up the command palette. Search for “task” and you’ll get the &lt;em&gt;Configure Task Runner&lt;/em&gt; command. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select it and press &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; to generate a tasks.json file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Custom-Tasks-for-Java-in-Visual-Studio-Code/configure-task-runner.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Custom-Tasks-for-Java-in-Visual-Studio-Code/configure-task-runner.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default &lt;em&gt;tasks.json&lt;/em&gt; file has some samples along with some reference variables at the top of the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, we create our task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configure a Task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if we have any errors, we want to run our Java compiler on our code to get any error. In the example below, I’m using a simple project with a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; directory where the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; directory contains all of our Java files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, clear out the other tasks in the file. We only want the one we’re going to use which is our javac command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the task to run the Java compiler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
{
“version”: “0.1.0”,
“command”: “javac”,
“showOutput”: “always”,
“isShellCommand”: true,
“args”: [“-d”,”${workspaceRoot}\build\classes”,”${workspaceRoot}\src\main\java\*.java”]
}
{% endcodeblock %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, we can run our command by hitting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Ctrl + Shift + P&lt;/code&gt; and typing &lt;em&gt;Run Task&lt;/em&gt; should show us our new Java task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Custom-Tasks-for-Java-in-Visual-Studio-Code/new-javac-task.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Custom-Tasks-for-Java-in-Visual-Studio-Code/new-javac-task.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select it to run it, and assuming you have an error, it should display something in the output window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Custom-Tasks-for-Java-in-Visual-Studio-Code/javac-output.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Custom-Tasks-for-Java-in-Visual-Studio-Code/javac-output.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re making progress, but it would be nice to see those errors inline in our code files, wouldn’t it? That’s where Problem Matchers come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Add a Problem Matcher to your Task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a task running, we need to tell Code how to process the output. We do that using configuring a problem matcher that uses a regular expression to parse the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what my task looks like now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
{
“version”: “0.1.0”,
“command”: “javac”,
“showOutput”: “silent”,	// changed so that the output window doesn’t pop up constantly
“isShellCommand”: true,
“args”: [“-d”,”${workspaceRoot}\target”,”${workspaceRoot}\src\*.java”],
“problemMatcher”: {
“owner”: “external”,
“fileLocation”: [“absolute”],
“pattern”: [
{
“regexp”: ”^(.+\.java):(\d):(?:\s+(error)):(?:\s+(.*))$”,
“file”: 1,
“location”: 2,
“severity”: 3,
“message”: 4
}
]
}
}
{% endcodeblock %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like the full scoop on how this works, you can check out the explanation on the Code documentation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks#_defining-a-problem-matcher&quot;&gt;writing problem matchers&lt;/a&gt; but basically each of the variables listed beneath the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;regexp&lt;/code&gt; represent a part of the VS code message that should display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve updated my task. If we run it again by hitting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Ctrl + P&lt;/code&gt; and typing &lt;em&gt;task javac&lt;/em&gt; we should get the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Custom-Tasks-for-Java-in-Visual-Studio-Code/error-inline.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Custom-Tasks-for-Java-in-Visual-Studio-Code/error-inline.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and if we bring up our warnings by hitting &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Ctrl + Shift + M&lt;/code&gt; we should see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Custom-Tasks-for-Java-in-Visual-Studio-Code/error-warning.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/10/Custom-Tasks-for-Java-in-Visual-Studio-Code/error-warning.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the warning, should bring you to the file with the error in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hey, Why Can’t I Add More Tasks to tasks.json?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great question! Although I don’t have an official answer, here’s my opinion: &lt;strong&gt;It’s a bad idea&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;tasks.json&lt;/code&gt; file is an IDE specific configuration file. All it’s really doing to making shortcuts through your IDE to execute different commands from the command line. So rather than setup multiple tasks for each individual command, you should do yourself and your project a favour and setup a build script and use that in your tasks.json file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A build script will have all the commands and scripts you need to run, build, test, or do whatever to your project. Plus, it’s usable &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of Code, so it’s much more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although totally customizable (which I’ll cover in &lt;a href=&quot;http://westerndevs.com/using-java-build-script-tasks-in-visual-studio-code/&quot;&gt;an upcoming post&lt;/a&gt;), you can see this action now if you’re using &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks#_mapping-gulp-grunt-and-jake-output-to-problem-matchers&quot;&gt;Gulp, Grunt, or Jake&lt;/a&gt; in your existing projects.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s pretty straight forward: I’ve annotated my object properties to match up with the appropriate JSON keys, Spring takes my POJO and turns it into a JSON string sends the request along with the JSON as the body to the HTTPS endpoint, et voilà!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been struggling with a JSON parsing error where my application is using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest/&quot;&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt; to send and receive messages from a RESTful Web Service. It’s pretty straight forward: I’ve annotated my object properties to match up with the appropriate JSON keys, Spring takes my POJO and turns it into a JSON string sends the request along with the JSON as the body to the HTTPS endpoint, et voilà!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem comes in when something goes wrong with the request/response. Because the Spring obfuscates the actual request/response content, debugging it means you need to take a look at the traffic being sent over the wire. Since we’re using a good RESTful service, the connection is done through HTTPS, meaning it’s encrypted with a certificate that we don’t have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, it appears that Fiddler doesn’t automatically capture Java HTTP traffic automatically, so that’s a thing too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some internet sleuthing, I put together a solution that I wanted to share with you all, and so that I don’t forget how to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downlaod and Install &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telerik.com/fiddler&quot;&gt;Fiddler&lt;/a&gt;. I used Fiddler4, because I’m awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run it and make sure it’s capturing HTTP traffic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;em&gt;Tools —&gt; Fiddler Options —&gt; Connections Tab&lt;/em&gt; and take note of the “Fiddler listens on port” value. It’s likely 8888, but best to be sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same window select &lt;em&gt;HTTPS Tab&lt;/em&gt; and make sure sure that the following options &lt;strong&gt;are checked&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture HTTPS CONNECTS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decrypt HTTPS traffic (…from all processes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset_img certificate-warning.png %}
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read, and if you’re alright with it, install the certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the HTTPS tab, click the &lt;em&gt;Export Root Certificate to Desktop&lt;/em&gt; and click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset_img fiddler-options.png %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Generating a Keystore&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a command line terminal as an administrator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the keytool for the JDK your application is using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;JDK_Home&amp;gt;\bin\keytool.exe -import -file C:\Users\&amp;lt;Username&amp;gt;\Desktop\FiddlerRoot.cer^
-keystore FiddlerKeystore -alias Fiddler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter a password and remember it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your keystore is created as a file named “FiddlerKeystore*. Take note of where it is located on your machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configuring Eclipse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; You are not required to use Eclipse for this, but it seems to be the popular way of writing Java code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your project and go to &lt;em&gt;Run —&gt; Run Configurations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the Run Configuration you want to use where you’ll capture the HTTPS traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the &lt;em&gt;Arguments&lt;/em&gt; tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following to the &lt;em&gt;VMargs&lt;/em&gt; textbox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-DproxySet=true
-DproxyHost=127.0.0.1
-DproxyPort=8888
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=&amp;quot;path\to\keystore\FiddlerKeystore&amp;quot;
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=yourpassword&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;em&gt;Apply&lt;/em&gt; button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;em&gt;Run&lt;/em&gt; button to try it out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset_img eclipse-settings.png %}	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tada! You’re done, and you should now be able to run your code and see the HTTP request and response, completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset_img fiddler-success.png %}
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alternative Solution --- Configuring Your Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following lines to the application that you want to capture the HTTPS traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;		// for capturing HTTP traffic
		System.setProperty(&amp;quot;http.proxyHost&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;127.0.0.1&amp;quot;);
		System.setProperty(&amp;quot;http.proxyPort&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;8888&amp;quot;);
		// for capturing HTTPS traffic
		System.setProperty(&amp;quot;https.proxyHost&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;127.0.0.1&amp;quot;);
		System.setProperty(&amp;quot;https.proxyPort&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;8888&amp;quot;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say that I really did like the Windows Phone 10 technical preview. I think that the new phone OS is heading the right direction, and that if you have a secondary device or want to be &lt;em&gt;“hardcore”&lt;/em&gt; , you should install it and check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll talk about that in a future post, for now I want to share the steps I took to downgrade my Lumia 920 from the Windows 10 Technical Preview back to Windows Phone 8.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not being a phone expert, the idea of downgrading incorrectly was pretty scary proposition as I didn’t want to ruin it nor lose any of my data. But, this weekend I managed to find the guidance from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.windowscentral.com/roll-back-windows-phone-81-windows-10-preview&quot;&gt;windowscentral.com&lt;/a&gt; I needed and it wasn’t nearly as scary as I thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the guide from windowscentral.com above. The tool is easy and self explanitory, and was quite happy that it just did everything it needed to do to get my phone back onto a officially released Windows Phone OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless I hit a few bumps in the roads that may or may not have been caused by me, but I would be remiss if I didn’t share my experience on the web, as hopefully it prevents someone else from hitting the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mobile Carrier Settings Lost&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one wasn’t such a big deal to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on the Windows Phone 10 preview, whenever a new upgrade was installed, I would lose my settings. Not sure why that would happen, but it did. The downgrade wasn’t any different. Here’s the fun part though: you won’t realize you don’t have a data connection until you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SIM card worked just fine as phone calls and text messages would come in just fine. Plus, my apps were downloaded and re-installed as I was on my wireless network, so I didn’t consider my data connection to be be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until I needed it out in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it’s not a big deal as you just need to take note of what your carrier settings are, or do a quick web search for them prior to make sure you have them on hand after the downgrade completes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Backup Your OneDrive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the downgrade was complete, all of my photos and files backed up on OneDrive were scortched. Not just on the phone, but in the cloud too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step burned me pretty badly, considering I had a bunch of photos of my new daughter on there and they are all gone now. Given, it may have been my phone settings or something else that I didn’t configure properly. Either way, I should have been smart and backed up my files onto a medium other than OneDrive itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a free service it’s great, but man does it burn when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the lowlights listed above, I liked the downgrading experience. It was simple, intuitive, and will encourage me to take part in future technical preview programs from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just make sure you back up everything before you do.&lt;/p&gt;

That is my spirit animal that was created on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CyrenaFriesen/status/627209542816829440&quot;&gt;Twitter-verse&lt;/a&gt; through the power of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com&quot;&gt;Western Devs&lt;/a&gt;, which I would not be a part of had I not become an &lt;a href=&quot;https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4032619?fullName=David%20%20Wesst&quot;&gt;Microsoft Edge MVP&lt;/a&gt; with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/08/Western-Devs-Found-My-Spirit-Animal/lobster-fire-mouth.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This amazing drawing represents a large number of “hilarious” stories that come from many conferences and adventures that have come through the MVP Program. Although I’m a bit late with the post, after being renewed this past April, I have had the chance to reflect on my five years and appreciate being a part of these communities for so long now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the Career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until last year where I realized how important these groups of people really were. I had experienced a family tragedy that really impacted me and my family, and it took me months to sort it out in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I was able to really grab onto to pull me out of the funk was my community within the MVP Program and my collegues from the Western Devs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it sounds sentimental, but it’s true. I almost quit all of my community work and thought wiping the slate clean and going nuclear with my career was the only way to start bringing back some semblance of normal to my life. All of that changed with the 2014 MVP Conference and was able to talk face-to-face with people and start finding my passion for technology again. I really focused on that, and have thrived on it since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is that I hope someone else reads this and realizes how important their profesional network is. Not just for the professional stuff, but as a reminder on why you “keep on keepin’ on” as some might say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know where things are going, but that’s okay. What I do know is that I love technology and with communities like the Western Devs and the MVP Program, I will continue to grow and expand my horizons with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Special Thanks To…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Darcy_Lussier&quot;&gt;D’Arcy Lussier&lt;/a&gt; for pulling the discussion out of the Western Devs fog and turning it into reality, as he did the lobster. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CyrenaFriesen&quot;&gt;Cyrena Friesen&lt;/a&gt; for making it a reality on Twitter. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dbelcham&quot;&gt;Donald Belcham&lt;/a&gt; for lighting the lobster on fire with scotch and reminding it that it’ll forever be in a ditch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Western Dev that goes by the name of Dave White found a solution and I confirmed that it works. The solution entails using a test build of the new Docker tool suite, so use at your own risk, but it does work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the solution from Dave White &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com/getting-docker-running-on-windows-10/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and learn more about the man himself &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com/bios/dave_white/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve hit some issues getting docker running on Windows 10. Turns out it’s an issue with VirtualBox and it’s being worked on, but I figured I’d share the details here just in case you’re having the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get the full scoop &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/1015&quot;&gt;here on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/14040&quot;&gt;here on the Virtualbox ticket site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those too busy to read the links, here’s the executive summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You install &lt;a href=&quot;http://boot2docker.io&quot;&gt;boot2docker&lt;/a&gt; on a Windows 10 machine, and you can’t seem to run the intro command &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;docker run hello-world&lt;/code&gt; as instructed by the installer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;boot2docker init -v&lt;/code&gt; you get an error &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Failed to create host-only network interface&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have VirtualBox 5.0.x installed and Docker gives you problems like those described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far there isn’t an official fix, but there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/1015#issuecomment-127313908&quot;&gt;test build&lt;/a&gt; as described on the boot2docker issue linked above. Personally, I haven’t given it a shot, but it looks like things are on their way to be mended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s hoping that it gets fixed so I can finally upgrade my desktop to Windows 10, and get docker running on my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

Not sure what it is? My fellow Western Dev &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westerndevs.com/docker-is-coming-whether-you-like-it-or-not/&quot;&gt;Kyle Baley&lt;/a&gt; explains it really well and provides some great cases about why Docker is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is an example of Docker being fantastic and should be considered a warm-up to Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I’m talking Tomcat and Eclipse, this idea can be used with pretty much any combination of technologies available through Docker and your development environment of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I dive into the code, I don’t want to have to worry about running some version of Tomcat on my development machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker can solve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also don’t like obscuring part of my solution through &lt;em&gt;IDE Magic&lt;/em&gt;, such that when I run my Tomcat application I want to know how it’s running. In fact, not only do I want to know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it runs, but I want the steps to run the application to be automated so I don’t have to think about it. I know Eclipse can do this natively, but because I’m not looking to run Tomcat on my machine, it adds some challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is a simple one, but it works consistently. Plus, we’ll even integrate it with Eclipse so people that don’t like leaving their IDE can continue to code in in their comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am assuming that you…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…are running Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…have a Maven web app project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…have setup Boot2Docker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…have a linux-flavoured shell (like Git Bash)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maven gives us a standard structure for our project. More specifically, it packages everything up into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/target&lt;/code&gt; directory so that we can map the volume to our docker image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s make this run every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Start Script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first script I created just packages things up, makes sure boot2docker is running, and runs docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that I run the script from the project root, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% codeblock lang:bash %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;!/bin/bash&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;package the WAR file&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mvn package&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Make sure docker instance is running&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;boot2docker up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Run the application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;docker run —rm -p 8080:8080 -v //./target/mywebapp:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/mywebapp tomcat:6.0
{% endcodeblock %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Stop Script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the power of Bingoogle, I was able to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://coderwall.com/p/ewk0mq/stop-remove-all-docker-containers&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% codeblock lang:bash %}
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
{% endcodeblock %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are my scripts to start and stop my application. The main reason for creating these is to make sure that anyone pulling down the solution can be productive. Even those that like staying inside of Eclipse all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Integrating with Eclipse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we have these scripts, we can setup a couple of “External Tools” to start and stop at the push of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/08/Running-Tomcat-Apps-on-Docker-through-Eclipse/1-externaltoolsbutton.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set it up, click the button or the drop down and select “External Tools Configuration”, then setup a couple of programs where you call sh.exe (provided with Git Bash) and our new scripts as the arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/08/Running-Tomcat-Apps-on-Docker-through-Eclipse/2-configwindow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now everybody can start and stop at their leisure. Plus, if we need to add more complexity to starting and stopping, we can just extend the scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alternatively…Make a Dockerfile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, we could also customize our docker image to include files right on the image rather than mapping volumes. Although this doesn’t add any value to this example, it might later on if we want to start customizing our Tomcat server to include multiple files or other libraries that our application will need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUN FACT:&lt;/strong&gt; Copying the files over to the image means that you can’t do any debugging on them in your environment right away, as opposed to if you were to map the files locally. Not a big deal in some cases, but I like to keep all the doors open for debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example, but you can get the full scoop on dockerfiles &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/articles/dockerfile_best-practices/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% codeblock lang:bash %}
FROM tomcat:6.0
MAINTAINER David Wesst &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:questions@davidwesst.com&quot;&gt;questions@davidwesst.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;add our WAR files&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/
{% endcodeblock %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we need to update our &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;start-docker.sh&lt;/code&gt; file from above to build the new image so we can run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% codeblock lang:bash %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;!/bin/bash&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;package the WAR file&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mvn package&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Make sure docker instance is running&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;boot2docker up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Build a new docker image&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;docker build -t davidwesst/tomcatsample:dev .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Run the application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;docker run —rm -p 8080:8080 umanitoba/tomcatsample:dev
{% endcodeblock %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty straightforward example on how to use docker, and how to tie it into any processes or IDEs that you may have. I know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2015/june/article3.php&quot;&gt;Eclipse Mars has functionality for docker&lt;/a&gt;, but sometimes we don’t get to use the shiny new toy and need to stick with the old realiable ones. This solution works with Eclipse Luna, and below from what I can gather, so people that are stuck using older IDEs can still enjoy Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…but you should really get comfortable with the command line and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/talks/&quot;&gt;Learn to be IDE Free (Shameless Self Promotion)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word “enterprise” isn’t used once to describe any part of the project, yet there are plenty of things I had to consider (or decide along the way) before I completed the migration. Eventually, I ended moving my &lt;a href=&quot;http://ghost.org&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; blog to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://hexo.io&quot;&gt;Hexo&lt;/a&gt;-based static blog, that is hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; under a new subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I actually did any of the work, I answered a handful of questions which helped guide me through the migration and ultimately feel much more comfortable with the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of this post as a checklist with a sample reflection on answering each question. Hopefully it helps guide you as it did me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions I asked were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#whatisthepoint&quot;&gt;What is the Point of your Blog/Site?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#whydoyouwanttomigrate&quot;&gt;Why do you want to Migrate?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#whatdoyouneedfromahost&quot;&gt;What do you need from a Host?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#existingreaders&quot;&gt;How will your existing readers find your migrated content?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#whatisallthecontent&quot;&gt;What is “All the Content”?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/07/Considerations-When-Migrating-Your-Blog/ghost-to-hexo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. What is the Point of your Blog/Site? &lt;a id=&quot;whatisthepoint&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question is something you probably asked yourself when you first setup your blog, site, or whatever. Now that you’re considering migrating it to a new technology, you should revisit why it even exists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great part about this is that there isn’t a wrong answer, as long as there &lt;em&gt;is an answer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m thinking about code, tech, and the what-not, I tend to skip the whole requirements gathering part of the work. Considering most of my career has revolved around defining requirements and designing user experiences to not only capture those requirements, but to enhance a user’s ability to engage the system, it’s pretty lazy of me to skip it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the questions I asked myself before getting into the tech:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is the audience for my blog/site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the definition of “content”? Blog posts, or is it more than that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I intend on sharing content?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outside of authoring it, what else do I want to do with my content?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there anything else outside of publishing content that I want to do with the blog/site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also asked the following questions, which have less to do with technical requirements and more to do with resource availability (for myself):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much time do I have to author content?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much time do I have to update application and/or server itself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where do I actually spend time authoring content?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was probably the hardest part for me. Because I like tinkering with new technology in my off time, I like spending time on that rather than worrying about requirements and the softer parts of my projects. Ultimately, I answered the questions, which really got me thinking about what my goals were for having a personal website and/or blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the blog is to publish thoughts and content from me to my audience, and provide the ability for the audience to comment. My website &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be the same thing, but I’ve always had a vision that it would be more than a blog. Given, I’m not sure what that something is, I want to keep that door open for future ideas and thus I have two applications: a blog and a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Why do you want to Migrate? &lt;a id=&quot;whydoyouwanttomigrate&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like an obvious question, but I tend to forget to ask this before any personal project. There really isn’t a wrong answer considering that you’re your own client, but you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able answer the question. If not, then you should keep on keepin’ on with what you have, and decicate your time something more meaningful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I had a few reasons. I wanted to…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…save my posts as markdown files to make cross posting easier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…to not have to maintain or upgrade the engine or server hosting the blog ever again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…move my blog to the &lt;em&gt;blog&lt;/em&gt; subdomain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…&lt;del&gt;setup&lt;/del&gt; fix the permalinks so they contain the date in the URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…make my blogging experience more “hackable” to keep me practicing and experimenting with new coding tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your reasons will likely differ. That’s fine. It’s important to know &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you’re doing all the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering this helped guide me on selecting my blogging technology along with my host provider. More specifically, to let go of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/felixrieseberg/Ghost-Azure&quot;&gt;Ghost on Azure&lt;/a&gt; and move to &lt;a href=&quot;http://hexo.io&quot;&gt;Hexo&lt;/a&gt; to generate the content and host it for on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. What do you need from a Host? &lt;a id=&quot;whatdoyouneedfromahost&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com/2015/07/Considerations-When-Migrating-Your-Blog/host-thoughts.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ties into the first question, but it’s more specific to the features you need from a hosting provider. The features of your host will have an impact on what you can accomplish with your site migration and depending on the technologies you want to use, the host may have some specific ways you need to implement them. For example, if you’re considering using something like WordPress, the hosting provider may provide you with a “standard install image” rather than having to setup the application from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I only needed the ability to host static files and to use a custom domain. I wanted an easy way to deploy, ideally so I can automate the whole thing at some point, but that was a secondary consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Windows Azure as a hosting provider as it makes me feel safe and in control of my blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, it was overkill for the amount of traffic I’m getting and how much I’m using it. I don’t need things like HTTPS or an online blog editor. I just needed a place to put the generated static files. My host selection was &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Page&lt;/a&gt; for the blog, and continuing to use a cheap Windows Azure site to handle the redirects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I outgrow my Github Pages site and need something with support and more control, then I’ll move it back over to Windows Azure or &lt;a href=&quot;http://surge.sh&quot;&gt;Surge&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/DsLu3K65J5w?list=PLbTA1UhK0wKjBJyqzA3aDrxcv9NdD1V8c&quot;&gt;I talked about a while ago on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. How will your existing readers find your migrated content? &lt;a id=&quot;existingreaders&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve worked on production web sites or applications, this is something you’ve likely asked your client. Being my own client, in this case, I have skipped this step a few times. Why? Well, I tell myself that my blog traffic is pretty small, so it’s too much work for such a small group of users, or something along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I realized that not only is that a total cop-out, but it’s an ass thing to do to your audience. If people are willing to read, share, or talk about any of your blog content, appreciate them and make sure that if or when they decide to share your content again, your laziness doesn’t make them lose street cred because they link they bookmarked on your blog no longer works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog was hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidwesst.com&quot;&gt;http://davidwesst.com&lt;/a&gt; on Windows Azure. This meant I needed to find a way to redirect people to the appropriate post on the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.davidwesst.com&quot;&gt;blog.davidwesst.com&lt;/a&gt;. After taking stock of all of my blog content, I setup new NodeJS application with a web.config file on Windows Azure that contains all the mappings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the file here on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/dw-website/blob/master/web.config&quot;&gt;GitHub Project&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iis.net/learn/extensions/url-rewrite-module/creating-rewrite-rules-for-the-url-rewrite-module&quot;&gt;tutorial URL Redirects and Rewrites on IIS.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. What is “All the Content”? &lt;a id=&quot;whatisallthecontent&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, sounds like an obvious question, but it can be deceptive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A web site, even a personal one, is a bunch of hosted content. Pages, media, and the links between them. If you’re using a content management system (CMS) to host your blog, then it has been taking care of all the logistics of linking your pages to your media files. Not only to do you need to figure out where those media files are so you can move them to your new application, you need to figure out how to possibly update references to those images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing overly complicated, but depending on how much time you have to spend on migrating and verifying your content, it can get overwhelming very quickly, especially if you have years of content saved up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a bunch of reseach on tooling that could help make this possible. Being that Ghost is a pretty new blog engine, the migration features are still a bit raw. Hexo, on the otherhand, has plenty of tools and have some pretty flexible &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexo.io/docs/migration.html&quot;&gt;migration options&lt;/a&gt;. Again, since Ghost is so new, nobody has written a migrator for it yet, although I doubt it would be very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, because of my time limitations, I took the more manual route root and used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexo.io/docs/migration.html#RSS&quot;&gt;rss-migrator&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/akfish/hexo-migrator-image&quot;&gt;image-migrator&lt;/a&gt; to get the content moved into Hexo. Then I updated the URLs with some regular expression magic in &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cheaped out on coding and just manually tested each post, but it worked with my schedule of just getting random late night hours at home to ensure the content moved properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Point&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you call the project &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt;, it takes some actual thought to make sure you do it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With smaller projects, whether they are for yourself or for your company, it’s easy to take shortcuts. The challenge is that for every shortcut you take, you end up living with it in the long run. In my case, I would constantly ignore the permalink redirection, which means I’m resetting my audience every single time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I wanted my blog to possibly be a portfolio piece for myself. If I take shortcuts and end up ashamed of the quality of work, I’m losing some of the value of my labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is valuable, and I hope that this list reminds me and others, that if you’re going to take the time to make something better, put your back into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the result of my planning by looking at the two Github repositories, one for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/dw-blog&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and one for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidwesst/dw-website&quot;&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t do anything other than redirect people to the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not sure how I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdevshow.com/&quot;&gt;MSDevShow&lt;/a&gt;, but I did notice that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/loriblalonde&quot;&gt;Lori Lalonde&lt;/a&gt;, the wizard of mobile development in Microsoft-land, was in &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdevshow.com/2015/03/cross-platform-voice-and-women-in-tech-with-lori-lalonde/&quot;&gt;an episode&lt;/a&gt; and decided “Why not?“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the episode I tweeted them my approval for the episode, Lori (who’ve I’ve met in real life) tweeted back, and I thought that was that…then I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdevshow.com/2015/04/news-a-palooza/&quot;&gt;the News-a-Palooza episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bam! They give me a shoutout on the episode at 2:15! That was an awesome and unexpected surprise, but it made me realize how important it is to reach out and &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; conversations, even if they are 155 characters or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It’s Not Just What You Know…&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also who you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cliché as that saying is, I really do believe it. A long time ago, in a casino bar far, far, away another Microsoft MVP told me: “You’re only as good as your network you bring to the table. You’re not going to know everything. But if you know people that know the other stuff, you’re still the hero.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m paraphasing, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shout out from the MSDevShow got me thinking about my nework, and how critical it has been over the years. Technically speaking, I’m now an Enterprise Java Application Developer, with a pinch of HTML and JavaScript. It sounds like a marjor left turn, but because I’ve been able to learn quickly and get advice through my network, it’s been a successful transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It’s Not Just Who You Know…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the network as been critical, I think it’s fair to say that I give back to my network with my own knowledge. The network is a two-way conversation, and you need to bring something to the table to have some credibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, If I didn’t have the development skills to give back to the network, then I would probably lose my credibility and ultimately lose the network, and this new gig wouldn’t have been an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cliché of “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know” is partially true. Rather it’s more “It’s &lt;del&gt;not&lt;/del&gt; what you know &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; who you know”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to make a move, realize that building and keeping a professional network of other like-minded individuals is just as important as being great a what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not interested in the retrospective, then you can head over to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidwesst.com/talks&quot;&gt;talks page&lt;/a&gt; to get the skinny and the resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Computer Science Career Awesomeness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant Park High School was kind of to invite me down and give me control of the computer science class for an hour to talk about “Careers in Computer Science”. Being that this is something I often end up hearing or discussing with my peers in the tech community, I figured it would be a good chance to share my knowledge with the future Zuckerberg’s and Gates’ of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I didn’t record the engaging conversation with the students, I did manage to make an &lt;a href=&quot;https://mix.office.com/watch/1awyqexjvlhq4&quot;&gt;online presentation &lt;/a&gt; that goes through the supporting slides. If you’re at all interested, definitely take a look and share your feedback with me here in the comments or via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidwesst&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prairie Dev Con 2015 — Regina, SK&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.davidwesst.com/content/images/2015/06/PrDCLogo_Small.png&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I delivered two presentations: Learning to be IDE Free (Java Edition) and 5 Reasons Why Your Website Isn’t a Native App. The latter is a re-imagining of my Winnipeg talk entitled “From Web to Device: A JavaScript Story”, where I received some great feedback from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/loriblalonde&quot;&gt;Lori Lalonde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mariocardinal.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Mario Cardinal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation transformed from, what was supposed to be a happy tale of how fantastic is it is to share JavaScript code between web and device projects, to a blunt conversation about just because you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do something doesn’t mean you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;. We focused on the development points, and so far the feedback has been great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No online presentation or demo recordings are available yet, but you can get the slides and source code &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidwesst.com/talks&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CSONHS 2015 Annual Meetup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.davidwesst.com/content/images/2015/06/entcanada-program.png&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you’ve never heard of the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology - Head &amp;#x26; Neck Surgery? Well, I have and managed to meet and work with some fantastic physicians and educators during my time working for the Faculty of Health Sciences. One of my many projects, along with being part of the Committee for Online Learning (or CoOL the group) lead me to becoming the sort of “tech expert” on some of the new systems installed and used for improving medical education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize it’s bit of a departure from what I normally discuss, but that was the idea: to change it up a bit. So far, it has proven to be a very interesting area for me and I hope to stay involved and provide technical expertise to physician educators looking to engage new tech. Plus, with things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.case.edu/hololens/&quot;&gt;HoloLens &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us/developer&quot;&gt;Microsoft Band&lt;/a&gt;, I think the healthcare and the health education landscape is about to see some major changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No real point other than to share the awesomely busy month I’ve had sharing and networking around technology and that you can expect to find more of my “talks” show up on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidwesst.com/talks/&quot;&gt;talks page&lt;/a&gt; of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow marks day one of the first ever &lt;a href=&quot;http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualconference.aspx&quot;&gt;Microsoft MVP Virtual Conference&lt;/a&gt;. This is awesome, because it’s a conference that I can attend that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn’t require time off from work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn’t require funding from by employer or out of pocket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covers a lot of great material&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan to attend is to tune in at 8am PT (10am CT, in my world) and soak in the inforamation while I go about my daily tasks at the office. Easy, peasy, lemon-squeezy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I’ve gone through &lt;a href=&quot;http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualconference-agenda.aspx&quot;&gt;the agenda&lt;/a&gt; and list off the top 5 sessions I’m eager to see over the next couple of days. Given, I’ll be watching more than that, but these ones just stood out more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to (virtually) see you there! Make sure you remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://aka.ms/mvpvirtualconference2015&quot;&gt;to register&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fireside: Cooking with Open Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1 - 10am PT/12pm CT | &lt;a href=&quot;https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Jeff%20Paries-4025625&quot;&gt;Jeff Paries&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x26; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Morten%20Nielsen-4032646&quot;&gt;Morten Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does this session talk about grilling, but it covers an area of interest: the Maker Movement with Arduino along with the open source side of things. My hope is that this session gives me a taste of what to look forward to when I start tinkering with one of these microcontroller boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Node.js for .NET Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1 - 3pm PT/5pm CT | &lt;a href=&quot;https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/David%20Neal-5001018&quot;&gt;David Neal&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x26; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Alvin%20L.%20Ashcraft-4025064&quot;&gt;Alvin Ashcraft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, I’ve become quite fond of NodeJS thanks to my familiarily and appreciation of JavaScript. I’m eager to see how David frames this session to show .NET developers why NodeJS is something to look into. Hopefully, I’ll learn a few things along the way too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Automation with PowerShell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 - 8am PT/10am CT | &lt;a href=&quot;http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/spotlight/Trevor%20Sullivan-20140926114956&quot;&gt;Trevor Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? An IT-Track session, you say? That’s the point. Conferences are meant to expand your horizons and learn a little bit more about what it out there. One thing that has caught my attention over the past month (especially after Build 2015 and the announcement of Nano Server) is Powershell. It seems very IT focused, but with Azure making setting up IT easier for the small-time developer, and Office going the road of SaaS, I think it’s time I learn to tool, and language that can help me manage my own little IT footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roslyn for Normal Developers: It’s Not Just for Compiler Geeks!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 - 9am PT/11am CT | &lt;a href=&quot;https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/John%20Robbins-10170&quot;&gt;John Robbins&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x26; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Jamie-5000814&quot;&gt;Jamie Dixon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roslyn is the new compiler for C# and VB.NET for Visual Studio 2015. It’s open source, and I’m intruiged because I want to see what developers can do with this technology at their disposal. Sure, it’s cool to say your compiler is open source, but why do I care? That is what I’m hoping to figure out in this session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Windows 10 and &lt;del&gt;Spartan&lt;/del&gt; Microsoft Edge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 - 11am PT/1pm CT | &lt;a href=&quot;https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Chris%20Love-4014103&quot;&gt;Chris Love&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x26; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/Ryan%20Hayes-4030617&quot;&gt;Ryan Hayes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this one is a gimme, considering my MVP area (that being Internet Explorer). I already know a lot, but I’m eager to see what Chris and Ryan (moderating) have to say being two of other experts in the browser space! You should check it out, as there are some cool things coming down the pipe, and I’m looking forward to getting my hands dirty with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for Playing. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 brought introduced a lot of new stuff in the Microsoft space, including how Windows 10 is changing up the web application game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big announcements was the name of Project Spartan. It is called Microsoft Edge. The browser, that is greenfield and forever evolving with web standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you wanted to learn more about the Edge of the Web with Microsoft, you don’t have to wait. &lt;strong&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://devchannel.modern.ie/websummit2015&quot;&gt;Microsoft Edge Web Summit&lt;/a&gt; is coming to you live from Mountain View, California on May 5 &amp;#x26; 6&lt;/strong&gt; and they are going to get into the details of Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it’s &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt;, BTW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can’t Make it Live?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me neither, but no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why they are going to be broadcasting the whole event on &lt;a href=&quot;http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WebPlatformSummit/2015&quot;&gt;Channel 9&lt;/a&gt; along side the Ignite conference. Load it up online and tune into the awesomeness of web standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what to watch? The first two hours with Charles, Paula, and Jacob, there are there’s a few others that caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Hosted web apps and web platform innovations&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;May 5, 12pm EDT&lt;/em&gt; —
They announced the idea of “hosted web-apps” at Build 2015, where web developers could extend their existing web applications to use native Windows features under specific conditions, like achievements in XBox. This should shed some light on this from the team that is making it possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Create Fun &amp;#x26; Immersive Audio Experiences with Web Audio&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;May 6, 12pm EDT&lt;/em&gt; —
Web Audio is cool, and I want to see how to use it in my applications. So, that’s pretty self explanitory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;What’s new in the F12 Developer Tools&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;May 6, 10am EDT&lt;/em&gt; —
I like F12 developer tools, and the improvements they’ve been making have bee great so far. I’m eager to see what Andy has in store of us in the next big release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Advancing JavaScript Without Breaking the Web&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;May 6, 11am EDT&lt;/em&gt; —
People seem to forget that JavaScript is a 20 year old language, and the fact that we are still using today the old stuff remains compatible. It’s impressive really, but takes some serious effort. I’m curious to know how the community is advancing my langugage of choice without changing it completely.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like podcasts. Especially the technical kind, but I find it’s challenging to find quality dev podcasts in the sea of options out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSDevShow is one that a discovered, and it did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MSDevShow: Real Conversations with Devs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://&quot;&gt;MSDevShow&lt;/a&gt; is hosted by two developers: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/carlschweitzer&quot;&gt;Carl Schweitzer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ytechie&quot;&gt;Jason Young&lt;/a&gt;. They host conversations with other developers who are working on project, or are able to comment on recent trends, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a pretty standard podcast, but it’s not. It’s because the conversations sound &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Real” isn’t Special, is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are great podcasts out there, but generally you need a bit of scripted content that results in someone interviewing another developer. When I hear unscripted podcasts, it generally (at least in my opinion) sounds awkward or boring because someone drones on about something for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On MSDevShow, they real conversations with developers. Sure, there is a bit of a script at the beginning, but it breaks the ice with the guest and gets them chatting, off the cuff on interesting topics. When they get to the conversation with the guest, the real, unscripted, conversation begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conference Conversations in Podcast Form&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I really like MSDevShow because it instantly reminded me something I enjoy about developer conferences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me the best part of any conference isn’t the lectures, or the demos, but the conversations with other developers. When you’re at a conference, you end up surrounded by people who are passionate about technology and code, just like me. Combine that passion, with an environment showing people the latest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSDevShow feels like they go to a conference, find a passionate developer, and record the ensuing conversation. That is something I’ve found is hard to find in the ocean of podcasts out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like MSDevShow. Maybe you will too, I don’t know, but you should give it a shot. Check out their episode list and pick one on a topic you like. I’m sure they won’t disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you make judgement about the design or the code or whatever, you can just take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zanyvideogamequotes.com/&quot;&gt;the 15 year old static site&lt;/a&gt; that is the source for this. My site is an improvement one way or another. Geocities FTW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Developer Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is NodeJS/JavaScript, hosted and fully powered by Windows Azure. Some decisions were made that I’m unsure of it at this point, but it was more important to get something out there and live rather than getting caught in the weeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zvgq/zvgq/&quot;&gt;source here&lt;/a&gt;, and make suggestions on how to improve things in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zvgq/zvgq/issues&quot;&gt;GitHub issues section&lt;/a&gt;. There is plenty of work to be done, I realize, and hopefully some feedback can help steer that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to contribute, that is high up on the list of priorities. Because I’m using Azure Table Storage, I’m having a few issues getting things up and running with the Azure Storage Emulator. Hopefully I’ll get something setup in the next while, but in the meantime, suggestions are always helpful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of this point: to celebrate the announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there are plenty of things I learned along the way, and I’ll be sharing these along the way here on the blog. Here’s a few ideas, but if you’d like me to share others, please let me know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 Things I Learned about Side Projects (in 5 Years)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent days, a specific YouTube channel has my caught my attention. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLx053rWZxCiYWsBETgdKrQ&quot;&gt;Lazy Game Reviews&lt;/a&gt;, and last night I came across a great playlist of only four episoded called: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB1vrRFJI1Q&amp;#x26;list=PLbBZM9aUMsjEVZPCDMl-lXOx50rSBNFQC&quot;&gt;LGR Tech Tales&lt;/a&gt; where LGR, the host, goes through a specific event in computer history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% youtube wQdK9owqVd0 %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s so Interesting?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of reviewing old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecxADZwybfE&amp;#x26;index=3&amp;#x26;list=PLFDCFCDFCF7E7ACDD&quot;&gt;PC hardware&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64_CJWYlJho&amp;#x26;list=PLbBZM9aUMsjF6-OXZikdTZL9F5OiYsXW0&quot;&gt;MS-DOS games&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere on the channel, this series struck a cord with me because it talks about the beginnings of Traf-O-Data, which we now know as Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find so facinating, are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/hJNaAG2BXow?list=PLbBZM9aUMsjEVZPCDMl-lXOx50rSBNFQC&quot;&gt;Digital Research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/wQdK9owqVd0?list=PLbBZM9aUMsjEVZPCDMl-lXOx50rSBNFQC&quot;&gt;IBM OS/2&lt;/a&gt; stories and how they relate to Microsoft. More specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When looking for a custom OS for their new PC, Microsoft forwarded IBM to Digital Research. It wasn’t until later that Microsoft bought a product and marketed it as MS-DOS 1.0 and took on the contract from IBM, due to frustrations with Digital Research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After commissioning a custom OS from Microsoft, eventually IBM gave up the contract and went to develop their own OS. That original OS, formely named PC-DOS, became Windows NT, the OS we all know and love today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve just really found LGR interesting. Looking back at computing history through the 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s shows just how different things have become. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I have no point other than old computers are really cool. If you’re interested in that kind of thing, then I suggest you check out LGR on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent days, a specific YouTube channel has my caught my attention. It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLx053rWZxCiYWsBETgdKrQ&quot;&gt;Lazy Game Reviews&lt;/a&gt;, and last night I came across a great playlist of only four episoded called: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB1vrRFJI1Q&amp;#x26;list=PLbBZM9aUMsjEVZPCDMl-lXOx50rSBNFQC&quot;&gt;LGR Tech Tales&lt;/a&gt; where LGR, the host, goes through a specific event in computer history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% youtube wQdK9owqVd0 %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s so Interesting?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of reviewing old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecxADZwybfE&amp;#x26;index=3&amp;#x26;list=PLFDCFCDFCF7E7ACDD&quot;&gt;PC hardware&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64_CJWYlJho&amp;#x26;list=PLbBZM9aUMsjF6-OXZikdTZL9F5OiYsXW0&quot;&gt;MS-DOS games&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere on the channel, this series struck a cord with me because it talks about the beginnings of Traf-O-Data, which we now know as Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find so facinating, are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/hJNaAG2BXow?list=PLbBZM9aUMsjEVZPCDMl-lXOx50rSBNFQC&quot;&gt;Digital Research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/wQdK9owqVd0?list=PLbBZM9aUMsjEVZPCDMl-lXOx50rSBNFQC&quot;&gt;IBM OS/2&lt;/a&gt; stories and how they relate to Microsoft. More specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When looking for a custom OS for their new PC, Microsoft forwarded IBM to Digital Research. It wasn’t until later that Microsoft bought a product and marketed it as MS-DOS 1.0 and took on the contract from IBM, due to frustrations with Digital Research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After commissioning a custom OS from Microsoft, eventually IBM gave up the contract and went to develop their own OS. That original OS, formely named PC-DOS, became Windows NT, the OS we all know and love today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve just really found LGR interesting. Looking back at computing history through the 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s shows just how different things have become. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I have no point other than old computers are really cool. If you’re interested in that kind of thing, then I suggest you check out LGR on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;YouTube-logo-full_color.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was planned to be a sort of experiment in content production, as over the past year I’ve really dived into the whole YouTube thing, to a point where we’ve cancelled cable in lieu of Internet TV, and I thought: “You know, I could probably do that”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, it’s consisted of four episode, and roughly four hours of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to take a moment to review some of the things I’ve learned so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Livestreaming Still Needs Planning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I watch a livestream on Twitch, or a coding video on YouTube, a lot of the time it seems unscripted and done in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’m right about the unscripted part, I don’t believe it was done in the moment. There is plenty of planning, setup, and familiarity with your tools that needs to happen to produce quality content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the four livestreams, I have managed to make errors in production on pretty much all of them in one way or another. Sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/LgMueH9-Ozg?list=PLbTA1UhK0wKhju4t2OFPll4iPvM_Vzw3O&quot;&gt;it’s the background music being too loud&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew5LB9gaGms&quot;&gt;I forget to push “Start Stream”&lt;/a&gt;, other times I forget that different platforms have different hardware configuration, which results in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiZ4rOVKUVU&quot;&gt;audio and video being out of sync&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still need practice with my configuration. Ideally, I’ll be setting up a more consistent environment in which I can keep things setup and ready, but there is a lot more I still need to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Editing is Time Consuming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment was supposed to yield both a livestream full-length YouTube video, and a shortended or “Minified” version. Though the series, I managed to make one minified version, and write a second that I never got around to finishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, I recorded the amount of time it took me to get the first video ready. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2-3 minutes of video, it was about 5 hours, plus time to create the assets like the intro animation, and end card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize it’s not that bad for most streamers and video people, but being that I’ve very new to the whole thing, it takes time to pickup a whole new set of tools and learn how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, editing, sound production, animation, and all the polish to make it appear clean is time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;That Being Said…&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be continuing to do more videos as I’ve got the tools and skills to keep it going, and in all it’s a lot of fun. I just need to practice more and start leaving my confort zone to try and explore new techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Celebrate Small Victories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube is very saturated, if not over saturated with content producers being that that only bar to entry is that you need a recording device on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, if you’re expecting to become the next big thing on YouTube, you should probably get your ego in check as you’ll be greatly disapointed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the success, there are people who make YouTube their full time job, and in all fairness, it’s not a great paying one for the most part. It takes a lot of time, energy, and possibly most importantly consistency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;That Being Said…&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a very low subscriber count, and not at many views as some. But I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; subscribers, and I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; views, which is awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had low to no expectations walking into this, but having a live chat aobut code with Cecil Phillip in episode three, and ultimaely having tons of different things happening all at once, all while coding, has been a lot of fun. Plus, now I’m building up a new network, and who knows where it will go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the point is that I like dong the “Vlog” or YouTube thing. It’s definitely different, and much more time consuming, but it forces me to practice skills that would be otherwise getting rusty, like public speaking, live demoing, and writing concise and ideally non-technical content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on continuing this YouTube experiment, but I want to change it up to be a little more versatile with the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, you can be sure I’ll be announcing it on the blog and maybe even with a commercial you YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/PSP_Browser.jpg&quot;&gt;Image Source: Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gl.access-company.com/products/browser/netfrontbrowsernx-2/&quot;&gt;NetFront&lt;/a&gt; is a web browser that I hadn’t heard of before, but I have installed on six of my devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a WebKit-based proprietary web browser that apparently is installed on nearly every non-Microsoft video game console since 2011. Go further back, Sony Playstation 3 and Playstation Portable (PSP) had a version of NetFront running on it back in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So doing some crude estimation for an install base:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://venturebeat.com/2013/11/05/playstation-3-sells-80m-units-not-bad-but-far-short-of-150m-ps-2-sales/&quot;&gt;80M PS3s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/06/sony-sells-70-million-psp-units-worldwide-still-firmly-in-ds-r/&quot;&gt;70M PSPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psvitahub.com/2014/07/ps-vita-sales-near-10-million-mark.html&quot;&gt;10M PS Vitas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/articles/wii-u-sales-reach-7-3m-3ds-sales-hit-45m/1100-6423241/&quot;&gt;45 Million 3DSs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/articles/wii-u-sales-reach-7-3m-3ds-sales-hit-45m/1100-6423241/&quot;&gt;4.5 Million Wii Us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gives us a rough total of 209.5 Million NetFront users out there that are playing games and could possibly be looking to surf the web with their devices. In all likely hood, likely for video game information being that video game media is generally distributed through the web in some way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, that the 200M major video game consoles with NetFront running on it. That doesn’t include all the other devices that include “digital TVs, set-top boxes, game consoles, car navigation systems and In-vehicle Infotainment (IVI) devices” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://gl.access-company.com/products/browser/netfrontbrowsernx-2/&quot;&gt;REFERENCE&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Frustration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I use one of my game consoles to browse the web, I’m generally looking up video game content and heading to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ign.com&quot;&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gametrailers.com&quot;&gt;GameTrailers&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://giantbomb.com&quot;&gt;Giant Bomb&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitch.tv&quot;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, their sites don’t appear to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the PS4, I get “Not Enough Memory” errors when I login to Twitch. I can watch it, but only if I’m not logged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or Giant Bomb or GameTrailers, where their videos just won’t load on the Wii U or PS4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video game websites not running on video game consoles. I realize it’s not everyone’s web platform of choice, but doesn’t seem kinda obvious that this should work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I blamed the sites, thinking that they were all going for the app approach like &lt;a href=&quot;http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/08/20/ign-app-launching-for-ps4-ps3-vita-later-this-year&quot;&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt;. But, that seems like a very difficult road to go down considering the number of app platforms there are already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in looking to figure out how to develop for these platforms, I found a lack of resources available. Sure there are ways of detecting, but there aren’t any developer guides for the platforms like IE for &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn532261(v=vs.85).aspx&quot;&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/jj883727(v=vs.85).aspx&quot;&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’m not sure. I just wanted to share it because it blew me back when I found out that there was another browser out there that was really relevant in my world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just find that web browsing through an appliance like a Playstation or an Xbox makes sense. Sure there is always the idea of putting a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/compute-stick/intel-compute-stick.html&quot;&gt;PC right on your TV&lt;/a&gt;, but maybe that isn’t the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s called Awesome Games Done Quickly, or AGDQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fund raising marathon, where for an entire week a group of gamers, known as speed runners, play a series of video games as fast as humanly possible. Sometimes is just someone on their own, sometimes it’s a race, or sometimes, it’s a blindfold challenge (i.e. the person plays the game blindfolded).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the marathon they accept donations that go towards a charity. This year, they chose the Prevent Cancer Foundation, and 100% of the donations go towards the charity. There isn’t anything cut off for administration fees or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset_img AGDQ-miketyson.png “Video Games Preventing Cancer with AGDQ” %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, they have collected over $530K in donations from people &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick&quot;&gt;watching on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, that doesn’t ever include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/&quot;&gt;the Humble Bundle package&lt;/a&gt; that people can buy and donate other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Huh?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t ask questions. It’s an amazing event and I am just blown away by the generosity of the gamer community along with insane skill demonstrated on these games. I mean, beating Mike Tyson’s Punch out in 22 minutes? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete insanity. I have yet to even get to Mike Tyson on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to share this as I find it cool and video games are a real passion of mine. I suggest you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick&quot;&gt;check it out on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/donate/12&quot;&gt;donate&lt;/a&gt; if you’re so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing. ~ DW&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Make New Habits with New IE VMs in the New Year]]></title><description><![CDATA[Happy New Year!

Time to start working on self improvement and developing new habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what habits to work on? Well, I’ll give you one: Test your application in IE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what do you know, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2015/01/06/ie-test-vms-on-modern-ie-get-a-refresh.aspx&quot;&gt;IE team has updated all their &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; VMs&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools&quot;&gt;modern.ie&lt;/a&gt; just in time for you to start testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Isn’t Spartan Replacing IE?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows. Maybe they are, maybe they aren’t. The important thing to note though that whatever fate IE has, it’s not just going to disappear overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=0&amp;#x26;qpcustomd=0&quot;&gt;NetMarketShare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;netmarketshare_dec.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, IE8+ has quite the presence. Sure, you can argue and throw &lt;a href=&quot;http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportClients.htm&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201411-201412&quot;&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php?year=2014&amp;#x26;month=12&quot;&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt; back at me, but all of the major players say IE represents a big chunk of the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spartan or no Spartan, IE has a presence that will stick around one way or another. So you should probably test it to make sure it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Couple of Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new VMs out, there have been a few changes for the good. More specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They use ZIP files rather than RAR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New download options (single download or multiple)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrades to new versions of IE are turned off by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, all the OS updates through until November are installed, so you’ll pretty much good to go as soon as they are downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are new VMs out and this is your chance to start testing your application properly, which needs to include IE whether or like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Thursday for the month of January, I’ll be getting familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cordova.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Cordova&lt;/a&gt;, in preparation for my presentation at &lt;a href=&quot;http://prariedevcon.com&quot;&gt;Prarie Dev Con&lt;/a&gt; in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal for the series will be to build a project that allows me a single set of source code, with multiple builds for web, Windows Phone, and Windows 8 applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I’m going to try and only use a command prompt and enhanced text editor. As in, no Eclipse or Visual Studio if I can help it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Schedule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the planned schedule, but being that this is a bit of an experiment, it may change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgMueH9-Ozg&quot;&gt;January 8, 2015: Warming up to Cordova&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup a base Cordova project and become familiar with the Cordova CLI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/Ew5LB9gaGms&quot;&gt;January 15, 2015: Making a Cordova App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build an application and start making somethign that actually does something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/Ew5LB9gaGms&quot;&gt;January 22, 2015: Getting Responsive-ble with Cordova&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We learn a bit about debugging and we make our UI responsive with jQuery Mobile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/yiZ4rOVKUVU&quot;&gt;January 29, 2015: Plugging in Script with Cordova Plugins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every database application needs a camera…right? We do this with Cordova plugins and discuss some of the limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, just subscribe by clicking the YouTube button below.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I continue to figure out how to best integrate video and streaming into my work, I hope to produce some cool content in the process to share with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see one of these Thursdays if not all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bonus Level&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in learning Mobile Developmentm, but not so much with Cordova? Or is Cordova CLI a bit too deep in the water? Not a problem! Check out these free courses at the Microsoft Virtual Academy that can help you get some foundational knowledge about Mobile and HTML Development outside of my YouTube series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-topics/html5?prid=ca_DevMVP_DW&quot;&gt;HTML5 Development&lt;/a&gt; courses teach you about Universal Apps along with HTML5 Game Development, which is a much friendlier way to warm up to HTML5 applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-topics/mobile-development?prid=ca_DevMVP_DW&quot;&gt;Mobile Development&lt;/a&gt; courses cover all topics ranging from the basics of mobile development to using Cordova in Visual Studio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching my YouTube based video game news on IGN News, I came across this report that blends the two worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% youtube 8ZnMI2ABw-I %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-building-a-new-browser-as-part-of-its-windows-10-push/&quot;&gt;this story reported by Mary Jo Foley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Does It Mean?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I don’t think Microsoft is abandoning IE or whatever the whole internet is reading into this story at this given moment, but I think it’s worth noting that this idea is making serious headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the story broke, I’ve received a handful of tweets and messages about the validity of the story. Unfortunately, I have no news to share with anyone. It’s unlikely that Microsoft would have secretly been building a whole new browser, but who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m just interested in the amount of buzz this story is getting. Give IE a Halo-based code name and suddenly the whole internet is interested in Microsoft finally “killing” IE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No point really other than this whole conversation and about this story is facinating, along with the buzz people are creating around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video flat out says “it will use Trident and Chakra”, which represent huge parts of IE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that Windows 10 is blurring the touch and desktop interfaces, maybe this is just a rebranding exercise to clean the slate for consumers, but keep IE alive for the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, it’s all speculation. I’m looking forward to the January event and hope to see some cool representation from IE at the headlining press event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for Playing. ~ DW&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Highlight Reel for 2014]]></title><description><![CDATA[This past year has been a rough one for me personally, but professionally, not so bad.

&lt;p&gt;I spent a good amount of time doing self reflection and figuring out what I found important for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I wanted to look back on what I consider some of my own highlights for 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inaugural YouTube Video&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset&lt;em&gt;img 1413245786&lt;/em&gt;youtube-128.png %}
This one is really late in the year, but it was accomplished. Get to the Point is &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/M5OQchl9bQA&quot;&gt;the first video&lt;/a&gt; of a series of short videos I plan on talking about code, video games, and hybrid topics in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s something I’ve wanted to do for quite some time now, and here’s hoping I keep it up in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Viva la Blog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this, then you might have noticed I’ve been blogging pretty regularily for the past few months. Not just here, but I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://d.wes.st/1yroBzI&quot;&gt;whole series on getting Ghost on Azure&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a custom theme and SSL on the Canadian Developer Connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog really was a great outlet for me to help me figure out what I wanted to do with my professional side, or whatever you want to call what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to keep that up. It’s a good way for me to play around with ideas and content and share ‘em with you fine people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back into the Speaker Spotlight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset&lt;em&gt;img imaginet-html5event&lt;/em&gt;small.jpg %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s an old picture of me, but you can imagine that my reintroduction into public speaking looked that awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took over a year off of public speaking, but broke the silence with a Winnipeg .NET User Group presentation I call Going Terminal: Learning to be IDE Free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, I’ll be heading to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prairiedevcon.com/&quot;&gt;Prairie Dev Con&lt;/a&gt;, here in Winnipeg, to present on a new dev story where we go from Web to Mobile App using Cordova.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Actually Finishing Up Projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;newzvgqtitle.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given I consider my blog and website far from complete, I have made some serious strides in focusing the time I have to code projects and have actually seen progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zvgq/zvgq&quot;&gt;biggest project&lt;/a&gt; has been the “New” Zany Video Game Quotes website. Something I’ve been slowly working on with one of my closest friends for years. It’s only now, nearly 5 years later, that I have something to show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t quite get everything I wanted done for January 1, but I made some serious progress and have something to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect more details on what I’ve learned and have planned for that project in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Embracing my Passion of Video Games&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have forever been trying to figure out a way to balance my love for gaming with my love for code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between my Twitch stream, and constant watching of YouTubers, I’ve decided it makes more sense to just embrace my love for both and work through finding the balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure where it will go in 2015, but I have some ideas. I’ll talk more on it in the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole point of this post is to actually sit down and share my self reflection on my professional and personal successes in order to try and figure out a plan for the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone for their support throughout this rough 2014 and you can expect to see more of me and some this refreshed DW in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bring you the pilot episode of my (hopefully) &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/M5OQchl9bQA&quot;&gt;new video series&lt;/a&gt; Get to the Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem&quot; &gt; &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.davidwesst.com//www.youtube.com/embed/M5OQchl9bQA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; style=&quot; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Powered by Office Mix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll go into details another time, but the pilot episode was done using &lt;a href=&quot;https://mix.office.com/&quot;&gt;Office Mix&lt;/a&gt;. I only have the video up on YouTube right now, but in time, I’ll be brining them to the Office Mix site as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, I’ve wanted to do a video series on stuff I like for a while. I like two things: code and games. In this video series, I’ll do my best to capture things I find useful or interesting, in a quick and concise video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Feedback Please&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking to do this regularly, so please so leave your positive and negative comments on YouTube, on the social media, or right here on the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://screeps.com/&quot;&gt;Screeps&lt;/a&gt; and it comes out tomorrow (November 20th).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset_img screeps.png “JavaScript Coding is Gameplay in Screeps” %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just any ordinary Strategy MMO game. Oh no. It’s a strategy MMO game you write JavaScript to control your units on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For realz, yo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brilliant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I code in JavaScript and, although it’s biased, I think that everyone should learn JavaScript in some way, shape, or form. Why can’t that form be by playing a video game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m planning on getting it on this game early on and possibly revisiting it in a future post this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest you give it a whirl too, and look me up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for (Hopefully) Playing. ~ DW&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ended up being a lesson in humility, and a reminder to think before you speak…or tweet in this case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share this simple reminder too those people out there who rush to reply and share an opinion rather than taking a moment to reflect before they speak.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Long Story Short&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my conversation with the creator of &lt;a href=&quot;https://chocolatey.org/&quot;&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ferventcoder&quot;&gt;Rob Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;, I managed confuse its machine package manager functionality with that of langugage-specific package managers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuget.org/&quot;&gt;Nuget&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.org/&quot;&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt;. Silly to most, but kind of embarassing considering &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidwesst/status/533798992270745601&quot;&gt;I’m the one that brought Chocolatey into it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I tried to correct the situation by acknowledging my confusion and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidwesst/status/533848025375195136&quot;&gt;replying via Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, but it was too late and &lt;a href=&quot;http://&quot;&gt;Simon Timms caught it&lt;/a&gt; and mocked me (rightfully so, might I add).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few lessons I took from this experience, other than the obvious one that machine package managers are not the same as meant to be platform agnostic, being that they are &lt;em&gt;machine&lt;/em&gt; package managers, which will depend on a machine platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Think Before You Tweet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the title says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you know what you’re talking about, that’s great. But take a moment and &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what you’re talking about before you hit enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I should have done a quick review of Chocolatey before I mentioned it in the conversation considering I have been living in my own platform agnostic paradise called JavaScript/HTML for the past year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that technology evolves over time, and quickly for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Engage with Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it might be exciting to have conversations with other experts via social media, it is important to make sure you know that your point is before you start engaging. If you don’t, you could get lost in the conversation and end up sounding like a goof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I logged into Twitter to find that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cecilphillip&quot;&gt;Cecil L. Phillip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tourismgeek&quot;&gt;Tugberk Ugurlu&lt;/a&gt; were discussing &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidwesst.com/can-asp-net-become-the-next-node-js/&quot;&gt;my post on ASP.NET replacing NodeJS&lt;/a&gt; and immediately wanted to engage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I got caught up in the excitement of engaging new professionals rather than actually making a point. This resulted in me confusing my words and ultimately getting Chocolatey confused with Nuget/NPM, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stimms&quot;&gt;Simon Timms&lt;/a&gt; winning the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s simple: know what you’re talking about before you talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a speaker in the development community, people tend to look at you as an expert. When you speak publically, know your point before you starting making them, or else risk misinforming people and ultimately losing a bit of credability in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ASP.NET and the KVM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t any secret as this demo was done a while ago by Microsoft, but ASP.NET 5 (formerly known as ASP.NET vNext) can run on OSX or Linux meaning we can host ASP.NET application on anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the K Version Manager (KVM) you install it and then manage the version of the .NET Framework from there. That way as they release new versions, your applications don’t break in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aspnet/home&quot;&gt;it’s open source&lt;/a&gt;. So, just download it and take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset_img githubaspnet.png “Can ASP.NET Become the Next Node.JS?” %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ASP.NET is Tried and Tested&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given JavaScript on both the client and server is a cool concept, and in practice is works considering if you know how to JavaScript on the client, you know a bunch of JavaScript on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, ASP.NET has been a server side technology for quite sometime. In fact, it’s been backed by a company that lives and breathes software as the core of their business. At the end of the day ASP.NET paid its dues and is tried, tested, and has experienced leaders at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NodeJS isn’t Growing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NodeJS platform improvement has started to slow down, not to say that it isn’t great, but there is always room for improvement in software. A platform that had fast and furious release cycles to include improvements and general changes to help mature the project quickly to compete with the likes of ASP.NET and Ruby. They have been working on version 0.10 for &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/03/11/node-v0-10-0-stable/&quot;&gt;almost two years now&lt;/a&gt; and there are still plans for version 0.12, which is supposed to follow-up with an official 1.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, NodeJS has recently come under fire with respect to &lt;a href=&quot;http://readwrite.com/2014/11/12/node-js-joyent-possible-fork-schism&quot;&gt;progress and direction&lt;/a&gt;, which could lead to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dtrejo.com/why-is-node-being-forked.html&quot;&gt;fork in the project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are groups like &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodeforward.org/&quot;&gt;Node Forward&lt;/a&gt; trying to get the ball rolling again, but Joyent is an infrastructure company, not a software one. Do they have an interest in moving the platform forward? Changing software platforms means upgrades and changes. Is there really a good reason for them to change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I don’t think ASP.NET is going to take over the NodeJS market, but I do think there is an opportunity for Microsoft and going cross-platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as NodeJS is sitting there stagnating, trying to find direction developers are going to keep on building software. At the end of the day, are you going to pick a new platform that quickly went silent, or a tried and tested platform that can work on any machine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 just might be the year of ASP.NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m making my public speaking comeback after nearly a full year off with a new original presentation called &lt;em&gt;Going Terminal: Learning to be IDE Free&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should register for the event &lt;a href=&quot;http://d.wes.st/14eIC13&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and book your seat. Admission is free and it’s going to be a great time where we go old school with our code and build a web application using a text editor, a command line, an empty folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Going Terminal: Learning To Be IDE Free&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How effective can you be without your IDE?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As developers, we tend to learn and rely on our IDE, but the value we bring isn’t only with the tools we can use, but the skills that we have outside of the tools and knowledge of how all the parts work together to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, David Wesst will walk you through the challenge of starting with an empty folder and turning into a real web application hosted in the cloud using nothing more than a terminal and text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No point other than I hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing.  ~ DW&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Remote IE - No More Testing Excuses]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today the IE team released Remote IE.

This is awesome. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;WP_20141103_002-1-.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IE on Everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize it doesn’t sound impressive, but with Remote IE we can take anyone’s device and let you render IE and test and view sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This removes the requirement of Windows on your machine to test IE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So? Isn’t this just a Public Citrix?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much, but the cool part isn’t the technology. The cool part is what it solves problem it. IE testing no longer requires Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers have no more excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No More Compatibility Excuses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, more importantly, this puts the responsibility for web testing on the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common complaint about testing sites in IE is that they don’t want to run VMs or they don’t have a windows machine available. Remote IE solves all of those problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No hardware requirement. No OS requirement. Just an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;banner.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now test your app in IE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To many, this might not be a big deal. From a technology point, it’s nothing really new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, remove the requirement for Windows to be needed to test in IE shows me forward thinking inside of IE and Microsoft. It also gets makes developers accountable for their web compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[SimCity in the Browser...with Source Code]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you haven’t played the classic SimCity, I mean Micropolis then you missed out.

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s already been done (and it continuing to be done) by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.graememcc.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Graeme McCutcheon&lt;/a&gt;, Mozillian and clearly super awesome dude, based solely on his choice of games to port to HTML5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let me show you the coolest thing about &lt;a href=&quot;http://micropolisjs.graememcc.co.uk/&quot;&gt;MicropolisJS&lt;/a&gt;, in my not so humble my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;micropolisjs-pullrequest.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/graememcc/micropolisJS/pull/17&quot;&gt;Yours truly contributed&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/graememcc/micropolisJS&quot;&gt;the project&lt;/a&gt;. Booya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Uh…Why is that Cool?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, SimCity is probably my favourite game of all time. Not the PC one specifically, but the SNES port that came out a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I contributed code to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my favourite language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sploosh. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/HC1NqZvY_lA?t=6s&quot;&gt;Reference is Kinda NSFW Audio from Archer&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You Didn’t Contribute Much&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, but I still contributed and that is the point. This represents something else to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, having a pull request accepted by an open source project is a new experience for me. If you go back two years, the idea of me being part of anything open source would have been ludacrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as more of a coding hobbyist rather than a professional (as I don’t get paid to code much anymore), I’m talking open source projects and use not much more than a terminal and text editor to develop and build all my code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s something of a major milestone in my personal and professional evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty direct: MicropolisJS is awesome, and so is open source. If you want to be awesome (like me) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/graememcc/micropolisJS&quot;&gt;fork the project&lt;/a&gt; and help out a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to help, it’s still a cool set of source code to download and play with to see a full working game in HTML and JavaScript. One that you can really recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;JS Compilation in the Real World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/compiling.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript and HTML5 are very present in the real world, but I hadn’t seen a deep case of cross compilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen Cordova, but that isn’t the same thing. That is going JavaScript to something else, rather than the other way around. Sure, I had found examples of JS compilation, but I didn’t have that awesome example that could “Wow” someone and show that compiling your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;insert language here&lt;/code&gt; could be compiled into JavaScript, which could then be made cross platform compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have eight examples thanks to Humble Bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Games Aren’t Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidwesst.com/the-difference-between-apps-and-games/&quot;&gt;Totally agree&lt;/a&gt;. — It’s a link to my blog post about that exact topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, games are highly complex software that demand high performance to work. Plus, gamers (a.k.a. the users) don’t care about the tech underneath the covers, they care that the game is fun. The tech just has to work, and work well, otherwise your game sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind, if it can work for games, it can definitely work for apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why seeing games go from C++ with asm.js to JavaScript and see the game run on the browser and the desktop is freaking awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Business Apps Should Learn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing dramatic should change other than the way you think about going cross-platform or web-based or both with your existing code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your current product or project roadmap, and start considering that you can take your code and port it to the web. It’s been done for code much more complicated than your LOB code, so really consider it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset_img javascript-compilation-flow.png %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what &lt;a href=&quot;http://cordova.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Cordova&lt;/a&gt; is? It’s an Apache project meant to take HTML5/JavaScript applications and compile the code into native apps. Basically, the next generation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://phonegap.com/&quot;&gt;PhoneGap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It’s Not &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; Easy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it isn’t. I never said it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am saying is that it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be done, and it has been done, which means compiling code into JavaScript isn’t bleeding edge, it’s becoming mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is why the Humble Mozilla Bundle is Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing. ~ DW&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Installing Games JavaScript Style]]></title><description><![CDATA[I bought the Humble Mozilla Bundle earlier this week and I wanted to take a moment to show people what it looks like to install a JavaScript…]]></description><link>https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/installing-games-javascript-style/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.davidwesst.com/blog/installing-games-javascript-style/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2014 16:20:41 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I bought the Humble Mozilla Bundle earlier this week and I wanted to take a moment to show people what it looks like to install a JavaScript game in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I login to my Humble Bundle account, I get this at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;play.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I click play and it installs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;ftl-1.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I play freaking FTL: Advanced Edition in the freaking web browser!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;ftl.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Room For Improvement&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are big pieces of software. Making them playable inside the browser isn’t a short order. Loading all the resources, like graphics, audio, and all that fun, is big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tried to play FTL in the browser, it took a few hours to load the first time. I mean, it’s downloading the whole thing. The second time around, it up within a few minutes, and I this time I noticed that “This page is requesting more than 50MB of space message” as I didn’t leave it overnight to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly there is room for improvement, but this is still a huge step forward for the way we can distrubute games and other software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a real use case of companies taking their non-JavaScript software and making it accessible via the browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take any LOB application that you want to port forward, and consider that you could make it accessible through a web portal, or inside of SharePoint, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you just worry the the game works in the browser and not the specific platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can buy games on Steam and play them in the browser or on your desktop through Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That. Is. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve bought the bundle already as I was already eyeing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.positech.co.uk/democracy3/&quot;&gt;Democracy 3&lt;/a&gt;. But being that we can compile game code into optimized JavaScript that runs in the browser is a game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is complex code, requiring high performance, running in the browser that wasn’t written in JavaScript. In my mind, it proves that JavaScript is the official connective tissue for all languages to all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have an app in C++? &lt;a href=&quot;http://kripken.github.io/mloc_emscripten_talk/gindex.html#/&quot;&gt;Compile it to JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; and try it in the browser before you buy it. Have a C# app? &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsil.org/&quot;&gt;Compile it to JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; and make a web-based version. Prefer Java over JavaScript? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gwtproject.org/&quot;&gt;Compile it to JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; and you’re back in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My worlds are colliding, and it is freaking awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Completionist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my bit of professional soul searching, I rediscovered my true passion for video games. In that time, I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPYJR2EIu0_MJaDeSGwkIVw&quot;&gt;ThatOneVideoGamer on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and really started to look at YouTube and web-based video as a serious entertainment medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lead me to the rest of their shows (links below) which are all professionally done, funny, and genuine. They’ve set a high standard for web-based videos, and I look forward to them continuing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I wanted to put my money where my mouth is and support this group that make shows that lead me to cancel my cable subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No real point other than the team at ThatOneVideoGamer is great and if you like video games and video game humour, you should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPYJR2EIu0_MJaDeSGwkIVw&quot;&gt;check&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperScopeShow&quot;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/ThatOneLaserClown&quot;&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/TheNationalDex&quot;&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really like them, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patreon.com/ThatOneVideoGamer&quot;&gt;support them&lt;/a&gt;, like me.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bower is an open-source client-side HTML package manager from the people that brought you Twitter Bootstrap and..well, Twitter I suppose. If you’re a Ruby or Rails person, it’s like &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/&quot;&gt;Gems&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a .NET person, it’s like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuget.org/&quot;&gt;Nuget&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a NodeJS person, it’s like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.org/&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s what makes it awesome: HTML and client-side JavaScript are BFFs within the world of HTML5. So, if you’re using HTML or JavaScript in your client, Bower is going to make remembering and setting up development environments easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Here’s what you do…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you install it using npm. Oh, we’re using the command line for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install -g Bower --save-dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We covered this last time, except this time the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;-g&lt;/code&gt; flag is installing it globally, so I’ll have access to it from in folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next navigate to the root folder for your HTML/JavaScript project and do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bower init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer all the questions, and now you’ll have a &lt;em&gt;bower.json&lt;/em&gt; that looks something &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zvgq/zvgq/blob/master/bower.json&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s all configured. Next time you pull your code from source control into a new location, you can just &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bower install&lt;/code&gt; and your dependencies will be installed into the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bower_components&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t want the devDependencies? Then use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;bower install --production&lt;/code&gt; and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;bower-screen.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even define a different installation directory with a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.bowerrc&lt;/code&gt; file in your project. There are other options too &lt;a href=&quot;http://bower.io/docs/config/&quot;&gt;you can configure&lt;/a&gt; too, but that one is the only one I use for my projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Package managers like Bower are nothing new, but for some reason, Bower remains moderately hidden to many that I talk to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and because it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodejs.org&quot;&gt;using NodeJS&lt;/a&gt;, it’s platform agnostic, just like JavaScript and how I like my coding tools.&lt;/p&gt;

I said it: Always use Node, no matter what! Even if your server isn’t going to be a Node server, just have it installed because you’ll use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? That’s what I’m going to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Before we start…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are plenty of other package managers for all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuget.org/&quot;&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rubygems.org/&quot;&gt;languages&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://getcomposer.org/&quot;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that NodeJS is better or worse than those. &lt;strong&gt;I am saying that npm is freaking fantastic for HTML developers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why do I need it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I start an HTML project there are always different tools I need. Not just script libraries, but things like compilers, or minifiers, or just something easier than Apache and IIS to run my code locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, we would have a “developer setup document” that the new person would get on day one, and work their way through it over the course of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was the document a pain for the person to understand most of the time, but the content became out of date pretty quickly as the technology that we used changed throughout the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrg.bz/VlafmO&quot;&gt;
Photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morguefile.com/creative/jppi&quot;&gt;jppi&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morguefile.com/&quot;&gt;morguefile.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enter Node and npm.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset_img npm-logo.png) %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I can define my development dependencies with Node, and my setup document would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone source code onto your local machine2.  From the command line, navigate to root directory3.  Type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;4.  Build it (Post coming soon)5.  Type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt;6.  Project is now running.7.  Start debugging things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it. The configuration is defined in the  &lt;em&gt;package.json&lt;/em&gt; file, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;awesome-sample-project&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;version&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0.0.1&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;private&amp;quot;: true,
  &amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;start&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;node ./build/index.js&amp;quot;
  },
  &amp;quot;dependencies&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;nconf&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;~0.6.9&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;azure&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;~0.8.1&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;express&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^4.0.0&amp;quot;,
  },
  &amp;quot;devDependencies&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;grunt&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^0.4.3&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;grunt-contrib-coffee&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^0.10.1&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;bower&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;~1.3.8&amp;quot;
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get the full scoop on package.json files &lt;a href=&quot;http://browsenpm.org/package.json&quot;&gt;here at browsenpm.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making it Easier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, writing the file yourself is necessary but as I add dependencies, I don’t want to always go into the file and tinker with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, npm has a solution for that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install bower --save-dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I always use &lt;a href=&quot;http://&quot;&gt;Bower&lt;/a&gt; (I’ll talk about that next time). The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--save-dev&lt;/code&gt; flag adds to the devDependencies section of &lt;em&gt;package.json&lt;/em&gt;. I can just commit the file to source control, and now everyone that gets the source code can use the tools I want them to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that they are installed, those tools are available to me. The tools work on Node, and Node works on all platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am platform agnostic. I win. Roll credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is simple: use a package manager. If not npm, then something that works for you and your project. Many people seem to skip Node, but as an HTML developer Node and the npm can easily keep your dev environments in sync, regardless of operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I skipped over Bower on purpose. That’s coming next time.&lt;/p&gt;

RequireJS is a dependency management framework I use in JavaScript to manage…well my dependencies.

But, the title is a play on words cause…of course you require JS…cause…JavaScript is required to…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah…well, I think I’m funny. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMpXAknykeg&quot;&gt;Sad Trombone&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;requirejs-logo.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://requirejs.org/&quot;&gt;RequireJS&lt;/a&gt;: it ensures that the JavaScript I need to run my code is loaded. I don’t need to worry about the order of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;lt;script&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags in the HTML. I don’t need to do any sort of checking or &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;onload&lt;/code&gt; event stuff, I just know it’s good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jsbin.com/OfIBAxA/10/embed?js,console,output&quot;&gt;See demo at JSBin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second reason: It defines a single point to start the application with the definition of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;data-main&lt;/code&gt; JavaScipt file. So, when I load an HTML page, I know the first line of JavaScript that will be executed and can build from there. Again, not worrying about multiple files loading at the same time and executing in parallel or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;html&amp;amp;gt;
    &amp;amp;lt;head&amp;amp;gt;
    &amp;amp;lt;/head&amp;amp;gt;
    &amp;amp;lt;body&amp;amp;gt;
        &amp;amp;lt;script data-main=&amp;quot;path/to/main&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;path/to/require.js&amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/script&amp;amp;gt;
    &amp;amp;lt;/body&amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;lt;/html&amp;amp;gt;
`&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

The `path/to/main` is a reference to a main.js file. RequireJS doesn&amp;#39;t need the JS, as it&amp;#39;s implied.

Plus, because of the whole &amp;quot;knowing that my JavaScript is already loaded&amp;quot;, I know that the libraries that I leverage (e.g. jQuery, Bootstrap, whatever...) will already be loaded and setup before I start running my application code.

#### Ha! What about your library dependencies?

I define and configure those in the RequireJS config JSON that gets run before we start the application.

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;`require.config
    paths:
        # dummy path for demo
        &amp;#39;jquery&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;http://davidwesst.com&amp;#39; 
    shim:
        # This is a sample of defining dependencies
        &amp;quot;bootstrap&amp;quot;:
            deps: &amp;quot;jquery&amp;quot;
            exports: &amp;quot;Bootstrap&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Double “Ha”! What about your text file dependencies?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t usually need it, but if I do there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text&quot;&gt;a plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, if you’re using text files to localize your site, there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#i18n&quot;&gt;another plugin&lt;/a&gt; to help that that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I start a project, I make sure I wire up RequireJS first before I start writing any code. Because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t need to worry about libraries and other script not being loaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know where my application will start every time the page loads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it gives me less things that could go wrong while I’m focusing on writing code. Plus, as a keep building the application, it forces me to think about what my “new” code needs to depend on as I go making it cleaner and easier for someone to get into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn about it here. Given, it’s a steep learning curve with that documentation, but I guarantee it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/2i0n5k/play_nintendo_an_official_new_website_with_games/&quot;&gt;a rising subreddit&lt;/a&gt; last night about the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://play.nintendo.com&quot;&gt;play.nintendo.com&lt;/a&gt; site that is built to entertain kids and provide resources for parents about video games and Nintendo games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;playnintendo-kirby.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why the attention?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m impressed to see Nintendo put some effort into creating &lt;a href=&quot;http://play.nintendo.com/activities/activities/&quot;&gt;engaging experiences&lt;/a&gt; using HTML5. My personal favourite is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://play.nintendo.com/activities/activities/mario-kart-8-party-starter/&quot;&gt;Mario Kart 8 Party Starter&lt;/a&gt; built on a canvas, or the “surprise” that happens when you click the question mark box (see above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;playnintendo-mariopartystarter.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it’s nothing major for an entertainment company create an interactive HTML5 web site and application, but I feel as though this is something big for a company like Nintendo to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve loved Nintendo for years, since I was a kid in fact. But (like many other video game companies) websites are not engaging, rather just informative places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing wrong with that, as the web is just that a whole whack of documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to see a big player, like Nintendo, take a leap into the rich and engaging modern web, I need to highlight it and applaud them for their effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next Steps for Nintendo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to embrace your fan community out there and let things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Diogenesthecynic/FullScreenMario&quot;&gt;FullScreenMario&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fullscreenpokemon.com/&quot;&gt;FullScreenPokemon&lt;/a&gt; become part of your web presence, rather than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fullscreenmario.com/&quot;&gt;killing them off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        title=&quot;coffeescript logo&quot;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That second question is also the answer: I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; a compiler, because a compiler can optimize my code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;For Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember our script from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidwesst.com/why-do-i-javascript/&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;? Well, let’s see that same thing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeescript.org&quot;&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jsbin.com/codizu/1/embed?js,console&quot;&gt;JS Bin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can compile it and get optimal JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;coffee myfile.coffee --compile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to worry about the nuiances of the language syntax nor what “optimal” means for JavaScript. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript&quot;&gt;whole community&lt;/a&gt; of people worrying about it for me which is put into the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, like I &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidwesst.com/why-do-i-javascript/&quot;&gt;said in the last post&lt;/a&gt;, JavaScript doesn’t really look like other languages. Sure, it’s easy once you get used to it, but so is eating broken glass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a background in C# which is more of a so-called “traditional” OO language, like Java, which I find easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CoffeeScript, although definitely not like C#, is easier for me read though and understand. The more I worked with it, the easier it became as the whitespace worked in my favour. Plus, I hear people that like indentation languages like VB.NET or Ruby, think CoffeeScript feels familiar**.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;**When I say “I hear”, refers to of some of the anecdotal I have had over the past couple of years with collegues. So take that as you will.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;But JavaScript Has “Normal” Class Definitions and Stuff&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re right…in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?do=show&amp;#x26;id=harmony%3Aspecification_drafts#current_working_draft&quot;&gt;ES6 standard&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, property modifiers kinda go hand-in-hand with class defintions and that is expected in ES7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to support platforms that are out &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, not next year or the year after. These platforms came out before that spec, and so they don’t support it. I’d have to use a compiler that abstracts me away from how JavaScript actually works just so I can use language features that will eventually be in CoffeeScript anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since…  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: “It’s just JavaScript” - &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeescript.org&quot;&gt;Coffeescript.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…I don’t learn to use features that don’t already exist JavaScript. When the compiler supports ES6 JavaScript, the new (more traditional) keywords will be supported there too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I think abstraction languages that do that are bad (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typescriptlang.org/&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt;), but I think that CoffeeScript is a nice medium that teaches me JavaScript functionality, with a simpler syntax, while giving me tools that make cleaning up and optimizing my code easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;For example…&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IE team &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2014/09/18/updates-to-our-platform-roadmap.aspx&quot;&gt;recently announced the support&lt;/a&gt; of ES6 features that are “In Development”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer is something of a major player on the web, so I probably want to support those users too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like CoffeeScript because it still allows me to learn the features JavaScript, while giving me a compiler to write optimal JavaScript, along with a simpler, cleaner syntax, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely more of a preference when coding JavaScript and isn’t really necessary. I just find that writing CS versus JS was just more intuitive with my background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is the native language of that whole “Internet” thing, plus it’s supported on a ton of platforms natively in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jsbin.com/gevur/4/embed?js,console&quot;&gt;DW JS FAQ - Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing special, right? In fact, the syntax doesn’t even really look “normal”. The point is the code can run on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Browsers (desktop, tablet, and mobile)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/windows/apps/br211385.aspx&quot;&gt;Windows 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.ubuntu.com/apps/html-5/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiiu-developers.nintendo.com/&quot;&gt;Wii U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-647&quot;&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.5.0/guide_platforms_ios_index.md.html#iOS%20Platform%20Guide&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.5.0/guide_platforms_android_index.md.html#Android%20Platform%20Guide&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davrous/archive/2014/05/12/creating-a-html5-phone-tablet-amp-pc-game-using-the-universal-apps-project-for-windows-stores.aspx&quot;&gt;Windows Phone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/platforms/webapps&quot;&gt;Amazon Fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps&quot;&gt;Firefox OS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps&quot;&gt;Chrome Apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/&quot;&gt;Blackberry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I’m over simplifying things, as the code won’t just run automatically on all these platforms. The hard part isn’t getting it run on the platform, but ensure that your user’s platform can run your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re some kind of name, or have a large scale brand or buzz or investment backing your idea, you likely aren’t going to sway your user away from their device(s) of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I ask once again: why would you limit yourself from day one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Point&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize there are a lot of things I’m not covering here; such as the fact that native apps have richer functionality when written in their native programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is totally true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if you don’t have a specific reason for sticking to a single platform, why would you limit your code base right from the start? Especially, when the native language of that whole “Internet” is JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, that is why I JavaScript and why I think you should JavaScript too.&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday, I reached out on Twitter, and the Canadian MVP network picked it up and helped me solve it in 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;AzureTwitter_2014-09-22.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the full conversation &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidwesst/status/514077951168897025&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that this isn’t special to a lot of people. When we have issues with code, products, or whatever, social media comes to the rescue with help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; network that is shared with the the world. I’m an MVP in Internet Explorer because of my work in the HTML space. Tyler is an MVP in Windows Azure. D’Arcy is an MVP in ASP.NET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us are local and know each other, but the fact that I could reach out and D’Arcy highlights it, and Tyler comes to the rescue to review my code on Github and find a solution is awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, he even apologizes (how Canadian, am I right?) about not responding over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not awesome just because the problem was solved. It’s awesome because of the level of expertise available to me to solve a problem on a side project. It’s awesome because a “consult” to do that same sort of thing would have taken a long time to sort out, rather than a 30 minute set of tweets back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s awesome, because I got helped because &lt;em&gt;they wanted to help&lt;/em&gt;, not because they had to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;MVP_Horizontal_FullColor.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that this is sort of patting my team on the back, but I thought I should take a moment to reflect on how amazing the Canadian MVP network has been to me over the years, and hopefully in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask Tyler for help on Windows Azure &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tyler_gd&quot;&gt;here on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.tylerdoerksen.com/&quot;&gt;here on the web&lt;/a&gt;. You can ping D’Arcy on ASP.NET/IIS and all things technology &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Darcy_Lussier&quot;&gt;here on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekswithblogs.net/dlussier/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;here on his blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday, August 14 was the day IE showed the Internet it changed. And get this…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…The Internet conversed with the IE team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/&quot;&gt;Here’s the link&lt;/a&gt; for yourselves to read, and I strongly suggest you take a look and read through for yourself. Are the highlights, IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great work IE team, and great work Redditors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BvBIK2TCcAAweX1.jpg:large&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Highlights&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you believe the reputation of Internet Explorer is something you can change? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq8m6w&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope so. Sincerely. A lot of things are changing. We announce the end of support for too old versions of IE or for out of date ActiveX control. This is a first step to reduce fragmentation which is really a pain for web developers (Which I’m part of :)) - David&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you feel about the fact that most people reading this AMA aren’t using your browser? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq8nj9&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenged :) - Anton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what is the IE team doing about fixing accessibility related bugs? I have filed quite a few, but have not actually seen any implementation changes as yet. some bugs are listed in the implementation testing results i conducted for HTML5 &lt;a href=&quot;http://stevefaulkner.github.io/html-mapping-tests/&quot;&gt;http://stevefaulkner.github.io/html-mapping-tests/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq8jph&quot;&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.html5accessibility.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.html5accessibility.com/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may help for this one. Can you send me repro case at [email address removed]? I will add them to our bug tracking system - David&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the biggest issue you’ve ever found in your browser? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq8n1r&quot;&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work on composition and rendering, so my bugs in pre-release builds tend to be pretty severe from a symptom perspective (e.g. “Uhhh… GMail isn’t rendering today, what did you break”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll catch super-severe bugs like that before we ship of course :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Matt Rakow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any plans to revamp the extensions stores and the like for IE (to match Firefox/Chrome)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there an overhaul for the desktop version of the IE UI in the works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you guys/gals get off the Windows release cycle soon and release monthly updates to IE (more than just bug fixes/security patches but features like Chrome/Firefox)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any chance that IE will become platform agnostic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any chance a uservoice/bug report system for the community will release?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebRTC support anytime soon (maybe with Skype support)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of IE but after using it as my daily driver some of the above would make it a lot easier to maintain as my go-to browser. Small bugs here and there can be annoying and having no way to suggest features or report bugs can be annoying. I never know if you guys will work on/fix anything I have on my mind (or other users minds I’m sure). Since you guys seem to be much more open I was hoping this could be a way to get a glimpse of the future. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dk60t/we_build_internet_explorer_i_know_right_ask_us/cjq8igv&quot;&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader Beware: This is just a personal brain dump. If you’re looking for technical content, this isn’t the post for you,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hypertext Gaming and Twitch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;GlitchIcon_purple-128x128.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.davidwesst.com/hypertext-gaming-starting-june-29/&quot;&gt;original plan&lt;/a&gt; for this was to focus all of my streaming on HTML5 related content. I planned it all out, and with doing three streams per week, for about 2 hours each stream, lead to a realization: I need a lot of content to fill that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it needed to change, and it has. Now I just do games that I want to do and “analyze” them in an attempt to eventually try and create my own game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of when/why/how of the game are still unknown. But, it’s refreshing to do something that is close to my heart and really a departure from what I’m used to sharing on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel like joining the conversation, head over on Sunday, Monday, or Thursday at 9pm CT to chat games, HTML5, or whatever is on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hypertext Gaming…is it still a thing?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing the Twitch stream has lead me down a path of learning how to do video content, and think down that line. For a long time, I’ve had content planned out for video casting, but wasn’t familiar with the tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing a livestream changes that, and I’m hoping to have some content (including HypertextGaming as a show) soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Codin’ Stuff and Projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I’ve pretty much reinvented myself as a developer by learning how to work without an IDE and using nothing more than a terminal and some kind of text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a success, and at this point I use a browser-based IDE to code sometimes, or VI, Notepad++, or gedit. I’ve even moved onto a Linux box to do web development and deploy it to the Azure cloud. Kinda cool, if you ask me (but I’m biased).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out my progress on &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/davidwesst&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; to see my commits. You can expect a series of developer videos on this in the coming months, as I’ve been planning it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see how it goes, now that the blog is upgraded and setup with all the bells and whistles I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blog/Vlog - Make Some Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the longest time I’ve wanted to vlog alongside my text-based blog, but have held off. With the Twitch stuff, I have the equipment to record things at the level of quality I want, and it has allowed me to work on my video conversation skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see where this goes, but I see this being the first set of video content I start posting on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, you’ve probably noticed some changes to the site. It’s going to do that as this is one of the projects I’ve been tinkering with that is going to turn into a video series if I manage to pull it together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to add comment to the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, that’s enough of a personal update. I’ll be in touch soon, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting Sunday, June 29th I will be hosting a livestream on Twitch I call &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitch.tv/hypertextgaming&quot;&gt;Hypertext Gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stream is my efforts to combine my two favourite things: HTML5 and Video Games into one conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is it?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is simple: to play, chat, and enjoy HTML5 videos games from all the different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to have a conversation about HTML5 gaming and put a spotlight it on. Nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What to expect?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format is still up in the air, but for now I have the plan to play HTML games, have some HTML-related guests join me live for the conversation (and play games), and then a bit of a technical deeper dive in HTML games by playing around with different tools to see what is out there with respect to game development in the HTML space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Where to find it?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch it live on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitch.tv/hypertextgaming&quot;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; or watch replays on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/hypertextgaming&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also join the conversation on &lt;a href=&quot;http://reddit.com/r/hypertextgaminig&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and suggest games for me to play or topics/themes you’d like to see on stream.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Back to Basics: The Text Editor]]></title><description><![CDATA[Goal To use a minimalist toolset to build and manage an HTML and JavaScript/NodeJS project from the ground up.

&lt;p&gt;To use a minimalist toolset to build and manage an HTML and JavaScript/NodeJS project from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Minimalist Toolset?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple: no Visual Studio or other IDE. This would allow me to do development on any device, in the literal sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I considered to be minimalist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text Editor (i.e. Not an IDE)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser based developer tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it. I haven’t done this sort of thing since I first got into programming back in university, prior to falling into Visual Studio in my third year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the introduction of Windows Apps with the Surface and Windows 8, I’ve had the facination about having a consistent way to code across all my devices that can handle a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an avid Visual Studio user, I started to see that the Microsoft development flagship did a lot of magic behind the scenes without me knowing what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, not only did I want to write code across platforms, but I also wanted to build something from the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; beginning rather than wait for Visual Studio to build the beginning for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, I need to step away from my all-in-one toolbox and get back to basics with some simplier tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up trying out a few, but these were my top three notable ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sublime Text 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;sublimetext.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the aesthetics of Sublime Text to be the best of the three,  especially the high level view of the file on the right. Still, it didn’t win me over in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The negative I had about it was trying to figure out why there was a price point on it. I get that software like this takes time and effort, and ultimately money. I just didn’t understand why I would pay for something that I deemed as a “pretty” application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the application has a lot to offer. For example, the large number of plugins through the package manager and the ability to write scripts to customize and tailor the experience. Still, it just didn’t grab me other than the aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Notepad++&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;notepadpp.PNG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used Npp a bunch over the years, but never as a primary code editor. Generally, it’s the replacement to Notepad on a server so that I can edit config files on the spot once and a while. This time around, I gave it a real shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I was impressed. More specifically, I was impressed with the ability to set the syntax colouring on any language and the officially managed plugin list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up installing a few plugins to allow me to browse through my file tree, and thanks to the Github community, I added syntax highlighting for both CoffeeScript and LESS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still using it now with my JS projects, but the web hipster in me misses Sublime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vim7&lt;/h4&gt;

  &gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;img
        class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot;
        alt=&quot;vim&quot;
        title=&quot;vim&quot;
        src=&quot;/static/1d0dce9674c52a993cd78f8bd2f4e319/f058b/vim.png&quot;

        sizes=&quot;(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px&quot;
        style=&quot;width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;&quot;
        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it finally happened: I dropped the GUI. Through the years, I have always tried Vim as I know it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be powerful. Unforuntely, I was never really able to get the hang of it…until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim gives me the ability to write my JavaScript on any platform, Linux or Windows as it’s totally command line based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what got me sold on it: the plugins. Again, the only ones I wanted should allow me to explore the file system and have syntax highlighting. Thanks to Github, I found that and managed to get it going in an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I’m using Notepad++ probably because I’m a cheapskate and don’t understand the price point for Sublime Text. I use Vim when I need to use a shared machine or device that has a terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the experiment was a total a success that between Vim and Notepad++ I get the ability to build code and project structure from the ground up myself, and be able to code from anywhere on any platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, you will get a browser that actually works (referring to IE11).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right everyone, I’ve been awarded the the Microsoft MVP award in the area of Internet Explorer again for 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is year four, and I’m as pumped as ever to keep it up for another full year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is to another year of being an IE MVP!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt; I haven’t been to BUILD, but I always follow it as Microsoft makes a bunch of really cool announcements throughout that pump me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are plenty of people talking about BUILD, but I thought I’d take a moment to share my favourite bits that came out of day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;IE11 on Windows Phone 8.1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not a WP owner, then you won’t care about this. You’ll just be missing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the browser on my phone often. It’s a continuous disappointment to me that phone browsers are limited in so many ways. Now that IE11 will be part of my Windows Phone, I won’t need to be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/microsoft-announces-windows-phone-8-1-with-cortana-coming-in-april/&quot;&gt;Cortana&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t hurt either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2014/04/02/announcing-an-updated-version-of-internet-explorer-11-available-on-windows-8-1-windows-7-and-windows-phone-8-1.aspx&quot;&gt;Reference - IEBlog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enhanced F12 Developer Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IE11 introduced a complete refresh of the F12 Developer Tools. With the IE11 update for Windows 7 and 8.1, we developers get some enhancements including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source Maps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to identify library files (to skip them when debugging)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updates to the JavaScript Console and CSS Editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get a more in-depth review of the dev tools from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2014-04-03-f12-refresh-the-javascript-debugger.html&quot;&gt;this post from Aaron Powell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2014-04-03-f12-refresh-the-javascript-console.html&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; about the JavaScript console, and finally &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2014-04-03-f12-refresh-css-editor.html&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; about the CSS editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidwesst.com/answering-the-question-when-will-ie-support-that-html-feature/&quot;&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; about it already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a huge fan of transparency when it comes to technology, and so I found this site to be fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enterprise Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset_img enterprise-minecraft.png %}
Old versions of IE lingering around the machines in a big enterprise has been a thorn in my side since I started up with the whole HTML5 thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IE has something of an answer. It’s called Enterprise Mode and it allows for the IT (not developers) to configure through group policy how IE should render certain URLs, for example to an old HR application that only renders in IE8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about from &lt;a href=&quot;http://love2dev.com/#!article/The-New-Internet-Explorer-Enterprise-Mode-or-Why-You-Should-Never-Use-IE-8-Anymore&quot;&gt;this post from Chris Love&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WinJS Goes Open Source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I’m not a big non-web developer these days, I like watching how I can leverage my HTML and JavaScript skills outside of the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always thought WinJS was a cool idea, but wasn’t quite what it needed to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Microsoft announced that WinJS is going open source. This will allow for the JavaScript community to actually get involved with development and possibly help form the furture of cross-platform development both on and off the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, combined with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmpoweruser.com/microsoft-introduces-universal-windows-apps/&quot;&gt;universal apps&lt;/a&gt;, makes HTML and JavaScript a very helpful set of skills when it comes to developing Windows-based apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the library on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/winjs/winjs/&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dn632015&quot;&gt;MSDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the tip of the iceburg, but this has been quite the day for HTML and JavaScript developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to see what happens on day two!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Answering the question: When will IE support that HTML feature?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tired of waiting to hear from Microsoft on whether or not IE will support the latest HTML5 feature?

&lt;li&gt;…what version of IE already supports the feature OR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…the current state of the feature in the development of new versions of IE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the latter option mean? In the screenshot above you can see that the &lt;em&gt;download attribute&lt;/em&gt; feature for anchor tags is currently Under Consideration. That means the current versions of IE do not support it, but the IE development team is considering it for future releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is another way that the Internet Explorer group is working to be more transparent and share with the development world how they are moving forward with the vision of IE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But Wait, There’s More!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more than just a IE version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://chromestatus.com&quot;&gt;Chrome Status&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only can you see details on HTML5 features with respect to Internet Explorer, but you can see what features the competition is has implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{% asset&lt;em&gt;img status&lt;/em&gt;modern&lt;em&gt;ie&lt;/em&gt;expandedItem.PNG) %}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see the state of the spec with the W3C, complete with a link. There is also a brief description of what the feature is, letting you browse and explore new HTML5 features that you can use in your next application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, this is a pretty useful application and a great place for developers to learn more about HTML5 features and what the IE team is doing about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out and send feedback to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/iedevchat&quot;&gt;IEDevChat on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share a pro tip with everyone on how I facilitate and ensure high quality communication in my professional life. Although there are many things I do, one of the key ones is my Office 365 account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I present this, I’m going to attempt to answer the two questions that I get asked about the most: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why do you pay for email and calendar? Isn’t Outlook.com Free?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;110513_1851_ProTipOffic1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of my professional life happens in my email. It might start with a web form I fill out, a contract that I’ve discussed, or a presentation that I deliver, but at the end of the day the communication ends up on my email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that that there are free options out there. I’ve used them for years, and still use them to this day. Although these services are great and are generally reliable, I have no form of support if something goes wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the professional space, my email and calendar is an integral part of keeping myself organized and communicating with nearly everyone. Whether it be other professionals, conferences where I’m presenting, or clients and stakeholder my email and calendar is managed through those services. I want to make sure that my email is secure, the service is reliable, and that there is support available if I need it. Exchange Online provides me with what I need to make sure I’m connected and organized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why do you pay for SharePoint?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;110513_1851_ProTipOffic3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SharePoint gives me two things: reliable document backups and a public facing website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;SkyDrive Pro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;110513_1851_ProTipOffic2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Office 365 and Office 2013, you get the option to install and setup SkyDrive Pro which is pretty much the same argument from earlier regarding email. I could get it for free, but if something goes wrong with my file backups (which it has) who do I have to call? In my experience it is a public forum that eventually gets dealt with, but being that SkyDrive is a free service, the number of support tickets are excessive and it just takes time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is a client going to be alright with you explaining that your backups in the cloud went missing? No. It’s on you to ensure that your documents and data are safe, and SkyDrive Pro makes that possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Websites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one I get asked about quite often. I’m an Internet Explorer MVP, and an IE User Agent. My passion is HTML which fuels the web. Why don’t I just create my own website? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have. Many times. If you’ve followed me via the web over the past 5 years, you definitely know it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem is that building a personal website isn’t my focus in my career or professional development. It’s another project that is taking time away from the projects that do more than just facilitate communication. My website is another communication tool, just like email. I could build my own, but I need a website as a service to communicate, not as another project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you argue that SharePoint is overkill for such a simple website, it ties in directly with Microsoft Office, it’s hosted reliably in the Microsoft cloud, and when something appears to be going wrong there are support staff ready to help me. In conclusion, it gives me what I need to communicate out into the web and provides me an easy way to post more static content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Office 365 gives me what I need to maintain my professionalism in the digital space. Between my public website, the document backups and management, and reliable Email and Calendar, it makes sense for me to subscribe to a service rather than try and piece a number of free tools together so I can save $9 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be a professional, then be a professional. If you’re willing to spend $7 at Starbucks on coffee every other day, why wouldn’t you spend $7 on having professional email, calendar, file storage, and websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and I didn’t talk about Web Conferencing. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;HTML5: The Parts You Care About&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML5 is here to stay, but how to you keep know what information is important and what is nothing more than the buzz. The goal of this presentation is to give you the knowledge and tools to you need to understand how HTML5 can be applied to your software development world. We will discuss and view the current state of HTML5, review some of the common assumptions going on about HTML5, and how to start getting you and your developers off to a good start with HTML5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The JavaScript Revolution: The New Age of Software Development&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are witnessing a major change in the world of software development, and it is time for you to embrace it. JavaScript is changing the way we look at platforms, as more and more “exclusive” technologies are embracing and supporting HTML5 and JavaScript. With the platforms changing to support JavaScript, so are our development tools and development infrastructure to allow for JavaScript compilation, continuous integration, and easier OO programming. In this session we will build a pure JavaScript /HTML5 project from the ground up that demonstrates the many tools and changes that have come in this new age, including JavaScript frameworks, compilers, and testing suites. We will also take a look at how even our build infrastructures are changing to include direct support for JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Typescript to the Max Extreme&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past year, Microsoft has released a new, open source, development language that we call TypeScript. This is no ordinary JavaScript abstraction, rather a true upgrade from JavaScript that can change the way you look at writing your JavaScript. In this session we will warm ourselves up to TypeScript to really understand what it’s all about and how to get ourselves going inside of Visual Studio, or outside. Then, we’ll move onto setting up our client app to use it, and push it beyond into the server-space as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there! If you’re coming out, drop me a line via social media or by commenting below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remake of Hover! (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hover.ie&quot;&gt;http://hover.ie&lt;/a&gt;) was released today to the web from the Internet Explorer. I want to highlight the importance of this game coming out to the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hover is a remake of a game that originally came out on Windows 95 and demonstrated the multimedia capabilities of the Windows platform. Making a game was an accessible way to demonstrate the power to regular Windows users. This is exactly what Hover! for in HTML is doing for HTML based gaming: showing everyone the power that is HTML. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE: If you are looking for the technical details on how IE made Hover! a next-gen game, they go into the details on their blog. Definietly worth a read if you’re an HTML developer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I distinguish next-gen HTML games by attemping to setup my gaming experience in a certain way. Here is the process I follow to setup a next-gen HTML experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to game site (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hover.ie&quot;&gt;http://hover.ie&lt;/a&gt;)2.  Go into full-screen mode by pressing F123.  Get into the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My process isn’t much to look at, I know, but that is the point. A great HTML game is just a great game. I shouldn’t need to do a bunch of crazy setup or have to ignore a bunch of problems. If I can’t go full-screen, then I’ll have distractions. If I can’t “get into the game” then, that is a problem with the game itself, but (at least for now) is likey due to distractions within the game platform itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Hover_Title.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So what makes it “Next-Gen”?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a good point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML5, the modern and ever-evolving web standard has been around for a while. So, why am I calling Hover! a next gen HTML experience? It’s because it’s a game that you can get immersed in the experience it delivers using nothing but HTML and open standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No special sauce. Just a full gaming experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at some of the more specific points that make it a next gen HTML game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Multiplayer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right. Multiplayer, PvP, bumper car awesomeness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You click “Multiplayer” and it gives you link to share with one or more players and you can get your game on. This is something that pushes the envelope, and it works using HTML and open standards. Maybe there are more 3D real-time multiplayer games that live in the web, but I certainly haven’t seen one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Hover_MultiplayerSetup_1.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;Hover_MultiplayerSetup_2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 1: Create a game and share the link with other players*   Step 2: Play Game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more we are starting to see cool HTML games that provide multiplayer like Lugdunon (&lt;a href=&quot;http://lugdunon.net&quot;&gt;http://lugdunon.net&lt;/a&gt;) and Bombermine (&lt;a href=&quot;http://bombermine.com/&quot;&gt;http://bombermine.com/&lt;/a&gt;) coming from the indie development scene. I think that moving forward, the bar is going to continue to be raised in what it can provide in terms of a multiplayer experience, and Hover! is definitely raising that bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Full Screen Experience&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I game, I don’t want to see an address bar, or a navigation bar on the left side showing me links to blogs or some kind of advertisement. A game needs to be a full-screen experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know technically it’s not a 100% full screen, but is certainly works as a full screen gaming experience. The curved window, the dashboard of your hovercraft, all of it just works really well. I wish the little “Learn More” link in the bottom left corner was a little more out of the way (although I don’t have a good suggestion on where to put that), but it looks and feels great playing in full screen mode which is something that makes this a next-gen HTML experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rich Graphics and Sound&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear that “rich” graphics and sound does not necessarily translate into 3D and digital 7.1 audio or something along those lines. What I mean is that a game needs to provide graphics and sounds that look and feel good for their experience. More and more we see games with pixel art take center stage and are better experiences for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hover! provides a nice 3D environment, complete with a soundtrack that fits and sound effects that word (I really like bumping off of things). Are they the best graphics and soundtrack that I’ve ever seen? Absolutely not, but they fit the game itself, and that is what is the most important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;It Feels Like a Game&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this is the most important of the next-gen characteristics that Hover! brings to the table. The fact that you navigate to a website, but that it doesn’t feel like you’re on a website makes all the difference in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, when I thought HTML games I thought of a website that had a game on a webpage rather than a full gaming experience. Hover! is a great example of how HTML game developers can redefine what it means to publish your game to the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Works in the Big Three&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I’m not talking Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. Rather, I’m referring to Microsoft, Google, and Mozilla with their web browsers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not seem like something that significant considering we are talking about a game built on open standards. But, it really is considering that the game was produced in collaboration with the Internet Explorer team. Moving forward, I believe that it is a requirement for next-gen HTML games to work across all three of the latest browsers, and with WebGL in place in IE11 there really isn’t an excuse for developers anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people look to HTML to build their rich experiences, I continue to see people not support Internet Explorer, or make an exclusive game/app for a particular browser. Unless you are building something that relies on an experimental feature, I don’t see why you can’t support all three big browsers. Sure, supporting the old versions is totally a pain, but supporting IE10 and now IE11, shouldn’t be a problem. If you think it is, explain to me why and I’ll probably poke a hole right through your logic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I see more of these games, it gives me hope that HTML is truly evolving past its roots of a document collaboration standard and turning into something bigger, richer, and more powerful than we thought. I applaude Daniel Church and the Internet Explorer team for making Hover! and raising the bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hover! has raised the bar. Who will be next to take HTML Next-Gen to the next level? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking Bad is coming to an end. We actually signed up for cable because we wanted AMC to watch the final season live and PVR it in case we were running late, and if we record it, then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the interesting thing though: we haven’t been late for a specific reason. That reason is the Breaking Bad Story Sync app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Story Sync?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story sync (as seen here, but does contain spoilers for the show) is a web application that plays along on a second screen (e.g. my browser window) that displays extra content about the show as you watch. Examples of content or videos of events from past episodes that relate to what is happening on screen, questionnaires to measure and compare audience reaction to events happening on screen and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you break it down, it’s a fairly simple app. It pushes HTML to your screen on timed intervals that match up with the show in progress. What it really impressive is that the second screen experience has gotten me sit through commercials on the show, and ensure that I’m home to watch it live on AMC. I can say that this is the first time that I’ve really appreciated a second screen experience, outside of the Nintendo Wii U when playing in a group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why HTML Makes the Second Screen Experience Better&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why I like that it’s a web-based second screen: I don’t need to install another companion app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m tired of installing companion apps on my phone when they don’t give me anything special other than stats and the occasional notification about some event that I likely won’t care about. What always blows my mind is that many of the apps that I’ve used, they require a network connection to even function. They require it. What is the point of installing a native app when I can’t use it without the internet? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an app that gives me data from the web that generally requires for that already. It’s called a web browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except (thanks to HTML5) I can use that offline to a certain degree. Plus, with pinned sites on Windows devices and the ability to put bookmarks on your home screen in iOS, I don’t understand why I need to go through an app store to get a native app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What about Development?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you build your second screen experience in HTML using whatever it is you want to use it for, you have multiple platforms that you can look to support, such as the Wii U, Windows 8/RT, and Web. Sure, there will be some device specific API you will likely need to take care of, but they will be JavaScript API made available by the vendor. It would be no different than using device specific APIs in any language, except this time its one language instead of the vendor preferred language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to a platform that doesn’t have natively installed HTML apps, you can use your HTML code in combination with PhoneGap and build yourself a native app the uses your code and provides the installed experience you’re looking for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why not look at offline HTML apps as an alternative to any native apps? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major players across the web support it, including those in the mobile space. So why not consider it an option? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Real-Life, Non-Gaming Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day at work we ran a focus group our core LOB application that we develop in-house. We reviewed some new features with students and opened up the discussion from the specific features we were reviewing to their overall perception and opinion of the application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “installed app” component came up during that discussion because they wanted to be able to access the data on the app without requiring a network connection. A 100% valid feature request considering that they are med students that work in the hospital, which has spotty network access at best. The immediate reaction was to make it available as an app, which is a logical conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catch is that it will be expensive to support all the platforms we need/want to support as we’ll need to have someone who is good with iOS and Android working to build these apps that integrate into our platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are other factors at play here regarding why people want native apps VS mobile web apps. More specifically the business and marketing side of things. But, with that being said, I’m starting to see the need for native apps fading away as more and more devices support HTML and JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, HTML/JavaScript apps on these platforms are still native apps. The key difference now versus two year ago is that you’re looking at using a single language and set of technology to support all the platforms you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the others &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidwesst.com/html-gaming-for-core-gamers/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidwesst.com/html-gaming-for-core-gamers/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a gamer for a really long time. Since the Commodore 64, but particularly when my dad brought home an NES in the late 80’s fro the US as they were exceptionally hard to come across in Canada. Having the family over to go swimming and play Duck Hunt and Super Mario Bros. was a defining moment in my life that has lead me down the path to love video games the way I do. I identify as a “core gamer”, which to me is someone who looks deeper into video games as a medium, much like movie buffs or cinephiles look deeper into film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’m trying to go from business application development to making video games in some capacity, I find myself challenged by the technologies that are discussed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do you put HTML Games in front of Core Gamers?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big question I’ve been struggling with since trying to produce and move into the video game development world. It always seemed to me that this is something that JavaScript and HTML game developers needed to clear up to their audience. When I talk to core gamers about the subject of HTML games, they respond with the same sorts of thoughts that plague me: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m not a big Facebook gamer, so they don’t really have a future for me.*   I’m a fan of deeper gameplay, not so much casual gaming.*   I only play games on my TV console, so that doesn’t really apply to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until PAX, I figured these were the questions that needed to be addressed head on when we made a game. I even noticed that a “Lessons Learned from Five Years of HTML Game Development” panel was scheduled. When I talk about HTML gaming, people hear “HTML” and they associate web. I need my game to get past that. How is anyone going to do that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer was found in the first hour of PAX Prime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Atari Arcade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the main expo floor, right near the front of the hall you saw a large booth dedicated to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://atari.com/arcade&quot;&gt;Atari Arcade&lt;/a&gt;. It was marked as Microsoft booth on the PAX map, but the focus of the booth was for people to compete for a chance to go to Tokyo by getting the high score in one of the classic Atari games hosted on the Atari website. At first I wasn’t sure what to expect, but when I returned I found this:. &lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A line up. A line up to play an HTML Game at a conference geared towards core gamers. Sure the IE logo was on the booth and on the swag they gave away (which I’ll talk about in a minute), but at the end of the day people were lining up to play an HTML game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blew my mind, but the secret sauce wasn’t in the prize or the swag they gave away. It was simple once I saw the booth: Gamers care about games, not the technology. It’s a web-based game, but that totally didn’t matter because they playing Centipede, a classic Atari favourite. They could play Missile Command, one of my personal favourites. At end of the day it was the quality of the game, not the technology that they were worried about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I’ve had plenty of conversation with gamers about technology and what can do this, and how something is more powerful than that, but really if the game is great the gamer looks past the weaknesses in the technology and plays the game. Regardless of whether its natively installed, has high preforming graphics code, or if it’s just JavaScript and and HTML canvas element. At the end of the day it’s about whether ror not it’s a great game or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IE team looked past all the questions we hear daily and just put a great game powered by open standards and said: “Hey! Come here and play that game you like from the 80’s”. The gamers respond with, “Okay”. How awesome is that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thanks Captain Obvious&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it sounds obvious, but this is something that I haven’t seen in all my reading and observing of the indie game scene over the past year. The HTML development discussion I see is always talking about the simplicity of the game and defending that it’s not as powerful as a native technology like Unity. To me not only hearing people play an HTML game they liked enough to line up and play, but also see that nobody was defending the technology to anyone, whether that was HTML or the web browser itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a real breath of fresh air, and really showed me that my thoughts of continuing down the path of HTML game development is the right way to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Developer’s Side Note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all ties into something that I saw at PAX Dev that really blew my hair back. On the floor for the conference, Nintendo had a booth setup for something called the Nintendo Web Framework. It turns out that you can use the Nintendo Web Framework to write JavaScript apps and games for the Wii U. The SDK is based on WebKit and handles web standards, but also provides some custom APIs for using the second screen that is on the Wii U gamepad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a top-down space shooter game, written using ImpactJS working on both screens. All pure JavaScript running on two canvases, the TV (which was rendering in 720p) and the WiiU controller, which displayed game stats on a second HTML canvas. Not the flashiest demo using the second screen, but amazing that I know all the moving parts to make a Wii U game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the full scoop go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiiu-developers.nintendo.com/&quot;&gt;https://wiiu-developers.nintendo.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I am feeling more confident about using JavaScript to get my game idea(s) off the ground. Sure, Unity is a leader and will likely continue to be that, but for now I’m going to use what I think is going to be the next true multiplatform technology: HTML and JavaScript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for Playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy, peezy, lemon squeezy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that there are a million or so of these kinds of apps out there. My favourite being the one built into the Internet Explorer F12 developer tools. But, this one lets you go outside of the browser window easily, and does exactly what I need it to do. Also, it’s out of the way, but always readily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great tool. You should download it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that I don’t like producing, but I would like to get my hands dirty at least once or twice on the development side to better understand the differences between game development the business-app development, which I’m already familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that got me thinking: what technology should I use to code? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a common question, and I don’t think there is a right answer. I think that it really depends on what my game values are. Right now, I’m in the beginning stages of developing my idea, and I think that picking a technology now would impact the game as the vision isn’t clear enough to develop. Nonetheless, I’m constantly thinking about what is out there and what options I have. Here’s what I’ve come up with regarding what matters to my game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Portability with minimal code changes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core values I want for my game is to be able to port it to multiple platforms without having to make a ton of changes. Sure, depending the platform I may have to add features that are specific to the platform (i.e. using a controller versus using a keyboard versus using a touch screen), but at the end of the day, the guts of the game should be easy to move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Community Support and Guidance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how educated I think I am about video game development, I’m not a developer yet. I’m a producer, which has nothing to do with the intricacies of game code. Being that I’ll be learning a lot about those sorts of issues, I want to make sure that there is a ton of support out there for language or whatever I choose to develop in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. That is a really short list, isn’t it? Apparently all I care about is portability and support in learning the tool. I guess that’s all my game would really need though. I want o maximize the number of players that can access the game, but I’m also looking to learn ONE tool, not 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! I thought of one: Web Platform Playability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever game I build, I know that I want it to work on the web in some capacity. I know that market is really young, but I’m totally sold on the idea of making a game accessible via the web early on so that you can share and get feedback from players sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if that applies to all studios, but given that I need to know if the game is fun or not before I try and sell it, it makes sense to be able to put it in front of as many people as possible. People aren’t going to want to constantly install an app or whatever, even if they are family and friends. I’ve been that localized beta user before, and getting me to install it once was fine, but again the next day, and the next day, and the day after that…Yeah, it just didn’t happen after the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, having the web as a supported platform is important to me. Plus, I happen to love the open web and moving and sharing things forward through web browsers. Now that we have HTML5, it’s getting harder to justify using a native tool or language to a specific platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what do I know, I’m just a producer right? ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ DW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author’s Note: I’m trying to pick between two major players right now: Unity3D and pure HTML5/JavaScript, which provide the features I care about in different capacities. I’ll write about this again as I’m constantly jumping back and forth on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Difference between Apps and Games]]></title><description><![CDATA[No, really.

Are they actually that different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of us are app developers and look at video games like they are some kind of foreign entity that we just cannot understand. They are art, not science. They are entertainment, not business. Games are a whole other beast. I’m sure there are a number of other explanations that I have been told over the past many years, but as I have attempted to look behind the curtain of video game development, being the producer on one for the past year, I don’t think they are that different, although there are some differences. &lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In video games, having a clear understanding of the vision is key. This is why you end up with someone that is responsible for knowing that vision inside and out. Why? Well, you need to know what sort of experience you are trying to deliver to your player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apps have the same sort of thing. We call them requirements and they act as the foundation for the software we are trying to build. But think about it: in a game your director has requirements too. Requirements like, “Tell my story” or “Have the player build a city” or “Make the player battle the evil octopus on the stage at the Opera House before the girl is rescued by the gambler with the airship”. How is that any different that, “Once the user logs in, they should see a welcome message immediately”. You can test both requirements. You can build both requirements. The difference, is that one of them must be delivered in a way that makes it fun. I’ll call it the fun factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you test the fun factor of game requirement like you can a regular requirement in an app? Of course you can. It’s called playing the game. Play any game, video game, card game, board game, or whatever, and you will immediately know if it is fun or not. Sure, you can’t measure fun using TDD or BDD. But you can definitely test it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen it time and time again, that as app developers we focus in on the making sure that the functional requirements are met rather than the experience itself. “The experience will come later” they say, but it never does. It’s not a priority. The priority is always these boring requirements that focusing on functionality. Shouldn’t apps have a “fun factor” too? Shouldn’t that fun factor have a priority in its development? If your apps users are enjoying using the app because it provides them functionality through an experience, maybe they will like it more. Maybe they’ll buy it and keep using it, and get their friends to use it and buy it and they will get their friends to use it and buy it, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about great apps. Does anyone say, “Wow, I love this app because it provides me these three function that I love, even though it looks like crap and it’s a pain to get the functions I need. I love it SOLELY on the functionality that it provides, and definitely not the experience that it provides along with the functionality”. Maybe they do, but I’ve never heard or seen that. The apps that stand out a bunch are the ones that have a fun factor. No, I’m not talking just about gamification or social media integration or something else that is seen as a “fun” buzz technology or design choice. I’m talking about people having fun with the app. I don’t really care how they have fun with the apps, but the ones that are talked about are those that have some kind of fun factor built into them, whether it was by design or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fun factor, although not a big focus in the app development world, is the primary focus of the game development world from what I’ve seen so far. The part app developers think is so foreign is making software that is graded on metric that isn’t easily measured, rather than a list of functions that need to be implemented. Personally, I think that app development would be much better if developers took some game development ideas into their realm, like having a director in charge of vision. That vision can be based on a set of requirements, but the vision of how to deliver those requirements is the part the director is responsible for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it’s not that cut and dry, but it’s a thought. Maybe that’s why I went into software development I focused on user experience. Maybe that’s why I always believe that a great user interface is the key to any successful software, games and apps alike. Maybe that’s what I was missing in my career, an emphasis on the fun and enjoyment of software. Maybe that’s why I love video games so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that mean that now that I’m in looking in the world of game development, that means that the only way I’m going to test my games is by having people play it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, making sure that a game is fun is the most important part of a game. That being said, the game has to function if you want it to be fun. If I’m playing Lovebucket and it crashes the web browser, then melts my hard drive. I’m not going to have fun. Hell, if I click on “Play” and then it takes me to the Options screen, I’m going to be annoyed. Annoyed is not fun, in fact being annoyed at something makes it harder for that something to make me have fun. Why? Because it annoys me, that’s why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End scene. &lt;/p&gt;

This is a regular occurrence for both of us, as we are both video game lovers and tend to lean towards single player games, and only have one television to share between us. Ultimately, we enjoy watching each other play through video games, but want to make sure that the non-player is at least going to enjoy themselves to a certain degree as we go through some kind of virtual adventure over the next few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She suggested (strongly) that I play through Grandia II on the Sega Dreamcast. I had never played the game, and she hadn’t played through the game in many years, and so it was decided. After our own real-life adventure of finding all the components needed to hook up her old Dreamcast and actually play and save games, I was good to go for my first play through of Grandia II. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, I am about 11 hours into the game which, from what I understand is a little less than half way. I must say: so far, so good! I was pleasantly surprised to see how well the Dreamcast and the technology around it had aged. Sure, it’s not photo-realistic, but that’s not what makes up a game. It’s the voice acting, the controls, the narrative, and the art, the music, and the everything else that I haven’t managed to list. These things, altogether have made for a truly enjoyable video game experience thus far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I realized something: this game, although a 3D TV console game, could be brought over to all the major web browsers by the end of the year. Now that IE 11 is supporting WebGL, HTML developers now have all the pieces supported they need to support this immersive, rich, and ultimately great RPG. Isn’t that…well, just really awesome? Think about 10 years ago and how the video game platforms were so different from the way we were developing web-based applications and games, never mind HTML-based web sites. Now, we can have the pieces to create a true multi-platform web experience inside of a web-browser, complete with 3D graphic, pre-rendered video, rich music, and (of course) voice acting at the important parts of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem&quot; &gt; &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3J_fCr_r7Jk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grandia II for the Dreamcast could become an in-browser experience &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to take note of this, as this reflection on what HTML technology is bringing to the table these days along with what the major web-browsers are adopting is really quite amazing. I never thought that when I started figuring out to write ASP.NET Web Forms to produce HTML many, many moons ago that I would be able to apply that same HTML-based knowledge to possibly writing a game that I, only years before, on hardware that was designed to push out rich and engaging video game adventures to my television. It’s pretty cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I think now is the time to explore WebGL. Not only will all the major web browsers support the technology, but because of what it means to be able to produce 3D experiences. Back in the days of Grandia II, 3D games were the standard. Everything needed to be 3D or else it was seen as technologically inferior to the other games out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that we need to start making 3D websites or apps or whatever, but we should at least explore the technology to understand what it can do to bring something new to our HTML development, whether it be game, apps, or whatever you want to make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of cool resources I have found that have helped get me started on the understanding and learning train. &lt;/p&gt;

The message this time around isn’t different than that, except the change is leading to a completely different direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last year or so, I have been feeling that I have lost my passion for technology. Although I truly enjoy my career and what I have been doing, I have not been truly passionate about everything I have been doing. My true passion lies within the world of interactive entertainment, more specifically video games. One of the key reasons for taking my new position at the University of Manitoba was to give myself more time to follow that passion, yet it has been almost 8 months since I have made the jump from the private sector and I have yet to take action towards my passion for video games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so here I am, making an attempt to re-invent myself through my blog, but this time I bring no promises to what changes will come of it. Realistically, I don’t even really know what is coming next but here is what I do know: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•I am passionate about video games. Classic Nintendo, indie games, mobile, whatever flavour as long as I can interact and play I care about it.
•My passion for the open web and an open standard to develop software will never go away. I truly believe that HTML5 and JavaScript are the real future for software, not just the web but all platforms people to consume software.
•I need to express creativity in some way, shape, or form. Ideally in the form of video games (although I don’t really know what that means yet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m feeling older or something. I’m not sure why I need to do this, but I need to take a stand for myself and really try and express and explore the creative side of my brain. For the first time in a long time, I feel as though this change is for my true self rather than the next step in my career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What You Can Expect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don’t know the exact details. I figure that will come as attempt to express myself creatively. That being said, you can likely expect me to be talking a lot more about video games and how an open standard plays a role in that world. I can see myself talking a bit more about my adapting my current skills to this new path and if and how they relate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t expect to stop the speaking at conferences, but my subject matter might change a bit towards topics that are closer to my passion of interactive media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that I launch my new blog. Wish me luck people, and drop me a line once in a while if you want to chat. I still a technology nerd at heart. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stop Hating IE and Be a Professional (Part 3)]]></title><description><![CDATA[This post is part three of three.

&lt;p&gt;It’s 2013, and it is time for people to get over their hate for Internet Explorer. Yes, IE has had its issues in the past. I know it, you know it, even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ie6countdown.com/&quot;&gt;Microsoft knows it&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the day, developers that whine and complain and about supporting IE are trying to be trendy and fit-in rather than be a professional. Supporting IE isn’t nearly as painful &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as the complainers make it out to be and that it actually makes the most sense for any web project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I ask the IE complainers to put their big boy/girl pants on by being &lt;em&gt;a leader&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to being a web professional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Be a Leader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;  
![][1]
&lt;figcaption&gt;Internet Explorer 10 is helping to solve the problem of old IE. Are you?&lt;/figcaption&gt;  
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that you are reading this post, people that you deal with consider you an industry expert. At this point, if you are still telling business decision makers that they do not need to consider Internet Explorer you are only digging yourself a deeper hole as there are arguments beyond “my users don’t use Internet Explorer” and never will. Remember that we already discussed the IE is used by Windows 8 and Office 2013 users, even if they don’t know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, if you are asked about supporting an old version of IE the professional thing to do isn’t to ignore IE, rather recommend a better version IE to be rolled out to the organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A professional is able to make recommendations about where improvements can be made and why they are beneficial to the client. Saying “IE Sucks” isn’t a professional answer, nor is it the truth. Old versions of IE suck, but your business professional likely doesn’t know or care about the difference, rather they want to know why an upgrade will benefit them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s early in the life of Windows 8 and the reinvention it has brought to the platform with Windows Apps, Apps for Office, and everything else coming down the pipeline, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get your clients and yourself ready for the change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a professional isn’t about complaining about what you dislike and trying to be trendy. It’s about leading people who ask you, as a professional, what they should do. Proclaiming that IE sucks that it should be ignored is only setting everyone else in your industry back, as someone like me who can be a professional and provide real solutions will need to clean up the mess you made. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stop Hating IE and Be a Professional (Part 2)]]></title><description><![CDATA[This post is part two of three.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work around a Microsoft platform you know that Windows 8 support native HTML5 applications, those being the Windows Store apps. What is the powerhouse behind these new apps? Is it some kind of special .NET complier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. It’s IE10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Windows 8 desktop and new Microsoft Surface is loaded with IE10 because it is the engine for all the new Windows Apps, which means that any Windows 8 or Windows RT user is going to be using Internet Explorer whether they know it or now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this relate to supporting Internet Explorer? Assuming that you expect your web application to be successful, you can probably expect that eventually you are going to want to make client apps on different end-user platforms thus making it more convenient for people to use your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using JavaScript and HTML for your web application, a large portion of your code (if not all of it) can be reused to build a Windows App for Windows 8. So, rather than having to go back and fix your website to guarantee it supports Internet Explorer, why not take the initiative and test it in IE10 to make sure the experience is as you expect. By spending the extra few minutes to test in IE, you’ll be ready to make an app for Surface and Windows 8 Desktops without having to “fix” anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and since you’re using IE10 (which is very HTML5 enabled) you can use the Developer tools to make sure it works for the other 30% of the web browser world by using the developer tools to render it as though it is using the older versions of IE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to complain about supporting IE, you have to realize that you are complaining about some pretty minor work. At the very least, complaining about IE support is basically complaining about how your app is going to be successful and people that use Windows are going to want use it in a different way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m crazy, but complaining about being ready for the future of your app seems fairly unprofessional. But hey, that’s just me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…And every client I have ever dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stop Hating IE and Be a Professional (Part 1)]]></title><description><![CDATA[This post is part one of three.

&lt;p&gt;It’s 2013, and it is time for people to get over their hate for Internet Explorer. Yes, IE has had its issues in the past. I know it, you know it, even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ie6countdown.com/&quot;&gt;Microsoft knows it&lt;/a&gt;.

Supporting IE isn’t nearly as painful as the complainers make it out to be and that it actually makes the most sense for any web project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I ask the IE complainers to put their big boy/girl pants on by being a realist when it comes to being a web professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trending complaint about not supporting IE is that their user base count is dropping. It really depends on where you get get your &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers&quot;&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt;. From my source, it is safe to say even with the numbers dropping, Internet Explorer represents at least 30% of the desktop browsers connecting to the web worldwide. That is about 750 million people, or potential users for your application (based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;750 million is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of people. I would be amazed to hear a stakeholder in your project say that we want to ignore 30% of the world &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when it comes to your app. If you really think that you can ignore that many people for your application, by all means go ahead, but I promise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you that any business decision maker focusing on making money with your web app is going to disagree with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be trendy to hate-on IE because of its legacy with IE6 and the pain it has caused in the past, but for the most part, IE support is something that needs to be done to be a professional in the web development world and in all fairness, if you really think supporting IE is such a pain you should probably question whether or not your development skillset is up to par. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Realistic Exception: China&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exception to the rule is China, where you find the majority of the remaining IE6 users. If you plan on supporting Chinese specific features, then you have some challenges you will need to overcome, but of all the people I hear whining about IE, I never hear them talk about the Chinese specific features they are building are a pain because of IE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
