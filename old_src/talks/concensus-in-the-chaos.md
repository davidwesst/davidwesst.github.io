title: "Consensus in the Chaos​: The Role of IT Architecture​"
shortDescription: "This session explains the weird and bizarre world of IT architecture. You will learn about the role an IT Architect and they work together navigate the enterprise to achieve the impossible of creating consistency across multiple business units with different goals."
description: "IT Architecture practice is a different kind of tech role. You code less (or not at all), you have more meetings, you write a lot of documents, draw a lot of pictures, and have no real authority over anyone or anything. Yet as bizarre as this role sounds, we continue to see more and more organizations create their own architecture practices to align their technology teams and forge a unified path forward.\nIn this session, you will learn about the role of IT Architecture in an organization and how IT architects work together navigate the enterprise and create consistency across multiple business units with different goals."
