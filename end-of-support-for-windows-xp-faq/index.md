If you are still holding on to Windows XP even though Microsoft has officially ended support for it as of yesterday read [this](http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/trending/smb/FAQ-for-Windows-XP-End-of-Support-on-April-8-2014).

[Brian Bourne](https://twitter.com/brianbourne), [Colin Smith](https://twitter.com/CistelColin), [Marcos Nogueira](https://twitter.com/mdnoga), and I some questions about why you should really consider upgrading at this point.

Not to mention, you will get a browser that actually works (referring to IE11).

Thanks for playing.
