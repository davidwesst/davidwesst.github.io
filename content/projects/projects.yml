    Why is keeping an inventory of your video games and hardware such a chore? With VGL, it doens't have to be. This web-enabled mobile and desktop application works right from the browser and DOES NOT require an account to get it working. Your inventory data is, and always will be YOUR DATA. The VGL just makes it easier to manage.
