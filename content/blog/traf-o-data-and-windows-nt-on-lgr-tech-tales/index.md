In recent days, a specific YouTube channel has my caught my attention. It's called [Lazy Game Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLx053rWZxCiYWsBETgdKrQ), and last night I came across a great playlist of only four episoded called: [LGR Tech Tales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB1vrRFJI1Q&amp;list=PLbBZM9aUMsjEVZPCDMl-lXOx50rSBNFQC) where LGR, the host, goes through a specific event in computer history.

## What's so Interesting?

Outside of reviewing old [PC hardware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecxADZwybfE&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLFDCFCDFCF7E7ACDD) and [MS-DOS games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64_CJWYlJho&amp;list=PLbBZM9aUMsjF6-OXZikdTZL9F5OiYsXW0) elsewhere on the channel, this series struck a cord with me because it talks about the beginnings of Traf-O-Data, which we now know as Microsoft.

What I find so facinating, are the [Digital Research](https://youtu.be/hJNaAG2BXow?list=PLbBZM9aUMsjEVZPCDMl-lXOx50rSBNFQC) and [IBM OS/2](https://youtu.be/wQdK9owqVd0?list=PLbBZM9aUMsjEVZPCDMl-lXOx50rSBNFQC) stories and how they relate to Microsoft. More specifically:

*   When looking for a custom OS for their new PC, Microsoft forwarded IBM to Digital Research. It wasn't until later that Microsoft bought a product and marketed it as MS-DOS 1.0 and took on the contract from IBM, due to frustrations with Digital Research
*   After commissioning a custom OS from Microsoft, eventually IBM gave up the contract and went to develop their own OS. That original OS, formely named PC-DOS, became Windows NT, the OS we all know and love today.

## The Point

I've just really found LGR interesting. Looking back at computing history through the 70's, 80's, and 90's shows just how different things have become. 

Ultimately, I have no point other than old computers are really cool. If you're interested in that kind of thing, then I suggest you check out LGR on YouTube.

Thanks for Playing.
