    <h2>The Short Version</h2>
    <article>
        <p>As a Solution Architect at the University of Manitoba, I specialize in modernizing legacy enterprise systems with a focus on user experience and cloud-centric platforms. With a Bachelor of Computer Science and nine years as a Microsoft MVP, Iâ€™ve built expertise in web technologies like HTML, CSS, and .NET, while sharing insights at conferences across North America. Outside work, I channel my passion for video games into designing original creations through Cocoboko Studios, combining technical innovation with creative storytelling.</p>

    <h2>The Long Version</h2>

        <h3>My Work</h3>
        <p>I am a solution architect at the University of Manitoba, that focuses on the migration and of legacy enterprise systems and bringing them into modern, more cloud-focused, and platforms.</p>
        <p>When I am not working in and around software code, I am usually talking about it in a public venue. Since the late 2000's, I have prepared and delivered original content for in-person technology conferences across North America, and continue that tradition whenever the opportunity arises.</p>
        <p>Through my career, there has always been a reoccuring theme in my work: user experience focused and customer enablement. Whether I was coding the solution directly, or creating a plan to migrate enterprise resource management (ERP) systems, the focus on the user experience has rarely failed me.</p>

        <h3>My Professional Origins</h3>
        <p>In my second year of university, I was trying to raise my GPA and was looking to sign up for a "Computer Usage" course. What I did, was sign-up for "Computer Science" by mistake, and the rest is history, ending with a Bachelor of Computer Science, with Honours and Co-op option.</p>
        <p>Beyond university, my career stayed in software development, with a heavy emphasis on open web technologies, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with a healthy dose of Microsoft technologies, like .NET, SharePoint, and Microsoft Azure. I was a Microsoft MVP in the area of front-end web dev, formerly Internet Explorer (yes, really) for 9 years running, where I  worked with various other professionals from around the world to help represent the revolution in web technologies as we see it today.</p>

        <h3>Outside the Office</h3>
        <p>In the evening, I tend to learn about video games-- my favourite entertainment medium. Although I play as much as I can, my focus for the past many years has been to learn the history, curate my own collection, and attempt to design and development my own original video game creations.</p>
        <p><a href="cocoboko-studios.webc">Cocoboko Studios</a> is the embodiment of my passion and drive to make video games. Although there are no releases yet-- the company is a work-in-progress and with some blood, sweat, and pixels one day I expect to see my ideas come to life.</p>
