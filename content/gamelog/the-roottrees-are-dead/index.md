The Roottrees are Dead is the closest game I have played that resembles the deductive gameplay style of Return of the Obra Dinn. It isn't as good as that Lucas Pope epic, but it was worth my time.

## What I Didn't Like

### The Length

The first scenario was great. The second scenario was a bit much, but was still welcome after taking an evening off. The ending, however, of the second scenario was where I felt burnout.

### No Variety in Gameplay

I read a comment about the game that uses the right words to describe this game: You are going down the Wikipedia rabbit hole.

## What I Liked

### The Mysteries

I liked figuring out the family tree through deduction. There is a lot to unpack, and there is enough subtle and not-so-subtle guidance to keep you on the track.

The people you research, some you are rooting (pun intended) for, while others you hope get what is coming to them. Which is what makes scenario two as interesting as it is, and keeps you wanting to go.

## The Conclusion
