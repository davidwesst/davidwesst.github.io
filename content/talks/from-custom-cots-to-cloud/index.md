They said they would never move our customized commercial off the shelf (COTS) application and move it into the cloud.\nThey were not a Solution Architect.\nThis session we will go through nearly 3-year journey to move a customized, Oracle-powered, on-premsis COTS ERP, and move it to a cloud powered version of itself with modern development practices.
