Starting Sunday, June 29th I will be hosting a livestream on Twitch I call [Hypertext Gaming](http://twitch.tv/hypertextgaming).

The stream is my efforts to combine my two favourite things: HTML5 and Video Games into one conversation.

#### What is it?

The plan is simple: to play, chat, and enjoy HTML5 videos games from all the different perspectives.

The goal is to have a conversation about HTML5 gaming and put a spotlight it on. Nothing more, nothing less.

#### What to expect?

The format is still up in the air, but for now I have the plan to play HTML games, have some HTML-related guests join me live for the conversation (and play games), and then a bit of a technical deeper dive in HTML games by playing around with different tools to see what is out there with respect to game development in the HTML space.

#### Where to find it?

You can watch it live on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/hypertextgaming) or watch replays on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/hypertextgaming).

You can also join the conversation on [Reddit](http://reddit.com/r/hypertextgaminig) and suggest games for me to play or topics/themes you'd like to see on stream.
