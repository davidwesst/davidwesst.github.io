2015 brought introduced a lot of new stuff in the Microsoft space, including how Windows 10 is changing up the web application game.

One of the big announcements was the name of Project Spartan. It is called Microsoft Edge. The browser, that is greenfield and forever evolving with web standards. 

Now that you wanted to learn more about the Edge of the Web with Microsoft, you don't have to wait. **The [Microsoft Edge Web Summit](http://devchannel.modern.ie/websummit2015) is coming to you live from Mountain View, California on May 5 &amp; 6** and they are going to get into the details of Edge.

Oh, and it's **free**, BTW.

## Can't Make it Live?

Me neither, but no problem.

That is why they are going to be broadcasting the whole event on [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WebPlatformSummit/2015) along side the Ignite conference. Load it up online and tune into the awesomeness of web standards.

Not sure what to watch? The first two hours with Charles, Paula, and Jacob, there are there's a few others that caught my eye.

###### Hosted web apps and web platform innovations

_May 5, 12pm EDT_ -- 
They announced the idea of "hosted web-apps" at Build 2015, where web developers could extend their existing web applications to use native Windows features under specific conditions, like achievements in XBox. This should shed some light on this from the team that is making it possible.

###### Create Fun &amp; Immersive Audio Experiences with Web Audio

_May 6, 12pm EDT_ -- 
Web Audio is cool, and I want to see how to use it in my applications. So, that's pretty self explanitory.

###### Whatâ€™s new in the F12 Developer Tools

_May 6, 10am EDT_ -- 
I like F12 developer tools, and the improvements they've been making have bee great so far. I'm eager to see what Andy has in store of us in the next big release.

###### Advancing JavaScript Without Breaking the Web

_May 6, 11am EDT_ -- 
People seem to forget that JavaScript is a 20 year old language, and the fact that we are still using today the old stuff remains compatible. It's impressive really, but takes some serious effort. I'm curious to know how the community is advancing my langugage of choice without changing it completely.

Thanks for Playing. ~ DW
