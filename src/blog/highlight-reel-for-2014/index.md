This past year has been a rough one for me personally, but professionally, not so bad. 

I spent a good amount of time doing self reflection and figuring out what I found important for myself.

With that in mind, I wanted to look back on what I consider some of my own highlights for 2014.

### Inaugural YouTube Video

This one is really late in the year, but it was accomplished. Get to the Point is [the first video](http://youtu.be/M5OQchl9bQA) of a series of short videos I plan on talking about code, video games, and hybrid topics in between.

It's something I've wanted to do for quite some time now, and here's hoping I keep it up in 2015.

### Viva la Blog

If you're reading this, then you might have noticed I've been blogging pretty regularily for the past few months. Not just here, but I had a [whole series on getting Ghost on Azure](http://d.wes.st/1yroBzI), complete with a custom theme and SSL on the Canadian Developer Connection.

The blog really was a great outlet for me to help me figure out what I wanted to do with my professional side, or whatever you want to call what I do.

The plan is to keep that up. It's a good way for me to play around with ideas and content and share 'em with you fine people.

### Back into the Speaker Spotlight

That's an old picture of me, but you can imagine that my reintroduction into public speaking looked that awesome.

I took over a year off of public speaking, but broke the silence with a Winnipeg .NET User Group presentation I call Going Terminal: Learning to be IDE Free.

In 2015, I'll be heading to [Prairie Dev Con](http://www.prairiedevcon.com/), here in Winnipeg, to present on a new dev story where we go from Web to Mobile App using Cordova.

### Actually Finishing Up Projects

Given I consider my blog and website far from complete, I have made some serious strides in focusing the time I have to code projects and have actually seen progress.

The [biggest project](https://github.com/zvgq/zvgq) has been the "New" Zany Video Game Quotes website. Something I've been slowly working on with one of my closest friends for years. It's only now, nearly 5 years later, that I have something to show.

I didn't quite get everything I wanted done for January 1, but I made some serious progress and have something to show for it.

Expect more details on what I've learned and have planned for that project in 2015.

### Embracing my Passion of Video Games

I have forever been trying to figure out a way to balance my love for gaming with my love for code.

Between my Twitch stream, and constant watching of YouTubers, I've decided it makes more sense to just embrace my love for both and work through finding the balance.

I'm not sure where it will go in 2015, but I have some ideas. I'll talk more on it in the New Year.

## The Point

The whole point of this post is to actually sit down and share my self reflection on my professional and personal successes in order to try and figure out a plan for the next year.

Thanks to everyone for their support throughout this rough 2014 and you can expect to see more of me and some this refreshed DW in 2015.

Thanks for Playing. ~ DW
