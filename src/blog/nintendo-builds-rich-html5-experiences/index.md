I need to throw a shout out to Nintendo.

I came across [a rising subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/2i0n5k/play_nintendo_an_official_new_website_with_games/) last night about the new [play.nintendo.com](http://play.nintendo.com) site that is built to entertain kids and provide resources for parents about video games and Nintendo games.

### Why the attention?

Well, I'm impressed to see Nintendo put some effort into creating [engaging experiences](http://play.nintendo.com/activities/activities/) using HTML5\. My personal favourite is the [Mario Kart 8 Party Starter](http://play.nintendo.com/activities/activities/mario-kart-8-party-starter/) built on a canvas, or the "surprise" that happens when you click the question mark box (see above).

I know it's nothing major for an entertainment company create an interactive HTML5 web site and application, but I feel as though this is something big for a company like Nintendo to do this.

I've loved Nintendo for years, since I was a kid in fact. But (like many other video game companies) websites are not engaging, rather just informative places.

There's nothing wrong with that, as the web is just that a whole whack of documents.

But to see a big player, like Nintendo, take a leap into the rich and engaging modern web, I need to highlight it and applaud them for their effort.

### Next Steps for Nintendo

You need to embrace your fan community out there and let things like [FullScreenMario](https://github.com/Diogenesthecynic/FullScreenMario) and [FullScreenPokemon](http://www.fullscreenpokemon.com/) become part of your web presence, rather than [killing them off](http://www.fullscreenmario.com/).
