Lot's of stuff really, but here's the big ones at 50,000 feet.

_Reader Beware: This is just a personal brain dump. If you're looking for technical content, this isn't the post for you,_

### Hypertext Gaming and Twitch

![][1]

The [original plan](http://http://www.davidwesst.com/hypertext-gaming-starting-june-29/) for this was to focus all of my streaming on HTML5 related content. I planned it all out, and with doing three streams per week, for about 2 hours each stream, lead to a realization: I need a lot of content to fill that time.

Ultimately, it needed to change, and it has. Now I just do games that I want to do and "analyze" them in an attempt to eventually try and create my own game. 

Details of when/why/how of the game are still unknown. But, it's refreshing to do something that is close to my heart and really a departure from what I'm used to sharing on the web.

If you feel like joining the conversation, head over on Sunday, Monday, or Thursday at 9pm CT to chat games, HTML5, or whatever is on your mind.

#### Hypertext Gaming...is it still a thing?

Yup.

Doing the Twitch stream has lead me down a path of learning how to do video content, and think down that line. For a long time, I've had content planned out for video casting, but wasn't familiar with the tools.

Doing a livestream changes that, and I'm hoping to have some content (including HypertextGaming as a show) soon.

### Codin' Stuff and Projects

Over the past year, I've pretty much reinvented myself as a developer by learning how to work without an IDE and using nothing more than a terminal and some kind of text editor.

It's been a success, and at this point I use a browser-based IDE to code sometimes, or VI, Notepad++, or gedit. I've even moved onto a Linux box to do web development and deploy it to the Azure cloud. Kinda cool, if you ask me (but I'm biased).

Check out my progress on [Github](http://github.com/davidwesst) to see my commits. You can expect a series of developer videos on this in the coming months, as I've been planning it for a while.

We'll see how it goes, now that the blog is upgraded and setup with all the bells and whistles I wanted. 

### Blog/Vlog - Make Some Content

For the longest time I've wanted to vlog alongside my text-based blog, but have held off. With the Twitch stuff, I have the equipment to record things at the level of quality I want, and it has allowed me to work on my video conversation skills.

We'll see where this goes, but I see this being the first set of video content I start posting on YouTube.

Oh, you've probably noticed some changes to the site. It's going to do that as this is one of the projects I've been tinkering with that is going to turn into a video series if I manage to pull it together.

Feel free to add comment to the bottom of the screen.

Okay, that's enough of a personal update. I'll be in touch soon, I'm sure.

Thanks for playing.
