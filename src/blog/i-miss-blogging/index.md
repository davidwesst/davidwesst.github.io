I miss blogging. 

I do a lot of game development these days, and I enjoy doing the [YouTube][1] videos, but there is something about tech and writing an blog post.

Maybe it's because I'm old. Maybe it's because I feel intimidated and challenged by [Dave White's][2] amazing series on his journey into Kubernetes. 

I'm not sure, but it doesn't matter. 

My time is my own, and I expect to write stuff on this blog related to tech, along with news of new YouTube videoes, and possibly some other nonesense along the ways. Web technology took me far, and just being out of it professionally doesn't mean that I need to be out of it completely.

In conclusion, expect me to write blog posts...maybe.

This concludes my test of my new blog-website architecture.

Thanks for playing.
