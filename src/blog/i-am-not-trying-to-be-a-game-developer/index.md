Hey friendos, it's me DW. 

It's been a while since I've posted a video and you should know that I'm still working on making my game, Out the Door. 

It's been a journey, both on the tech side and for myself, but this post isn't about the game directly. 

This one is about me, and the truth that I've come up realize since my last video: 
I am not trying to be a game developer...but I am definitely trying to make a game. 

# What does that even mean? 
It means that I'm not aiming to get into game development business or quit my job or anything oh so drastic. 

I'm in it for myself and to achieve a life goal: to make and sell a video game of my own design on PC and a console. I'm not trying to change my career trajectory. 

If my game ends up some runaway indie success story, sure I'll consider it, but that's not the goal. The goal is more personal than professional, and I think that distinction is important for you to know. 

# Uh...cool. I mean't what does mean _for me, the viewer/reader_

*cough* Of course...

It means my content is going to vary a bit. The YouTube channel is still going to focus around game development, but expect to see some content around what is currently influencing or inspriring my game development efforts and analysis of tools I'm exploring or just find interesting. 

You know, when I write/say it out loud, it's not that different than it has been the past couple of years. 

Really, it's just more of a mind shift for me. I'm streaming gameplay gameplay over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/), where I'm going through my personal collection of games and reviving the WTF (Where's the Fun) series over on YouTube.

I've also revived my blog, where I share my inner monologue, whatever that may be that week. It ranges beyond game development, but if you want to know more about my mindset and work, that's where you'll find more. 

# TL;DR; / Conclusion
I'm finally ready to return to YouTube with gamedev content, but my mindset is different. The truth is, I'm not trying to be a game developer, but rather I'm trying to achieve a life goal my making a game. 

My blog is back with my full inner monologue, and I'm searching for inspiration in my personal collection over on Twitch.

YouTube will stay game dev focused, but expect to hear more about what I find and learn on my journey, rather than just project updates.

Thanks for playing.
