Last week I delivered three presentations: one at the [Winnipeg .NET User Group](http://winnipegdotnet.org/) and the other two at [Winnipeg Code Camp](http://winnipegcodecamp.com/). Being as awesome as we are, the user group presentation was recorded and has been published on the YouTube page.

The presentation gives you an overview of the open source, cross-platform, code editor and covers:
	+ The Editor Itself
	+ Debugging Experience
	+ Tasks, including integrating with Java-based task runner Gradle
	+ Extensions, including writing your own
	
Feedback is always appreciated, and hopefully I'll get to see you at the next event in the new year.
