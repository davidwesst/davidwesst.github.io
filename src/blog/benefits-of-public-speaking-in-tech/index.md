I was lucky enough to have a couple of my sessions selected for the three [Prairie Dev Con 2022][1] events which allowed me to do some public speaking at a tech conference for the first time in almost three years. After such a long absense from public speaking, and with more experience dabbling with livestreaming, I wanted to highlight the benefits of doing IRL public speaking that may not be obvious to those who are more familiar with livestreaming.

## Benefits = Different Soft Skills than Livestreaming


### The Pitch Process

Stuff I wrote on my laptop goes here.

### Reading the Room

Seeing the audience makes a difference.

### Prepared Content instead of Planned Content

Making a lecture instead of planning a stream

## TL;DR; / Conclusion

- The pitch process associated with submitting session to a conference forces you to "sell" your content, rather than yourself
- Sharing the air with your audience allows you to read your audience much better than any chat window or web cam could convey
