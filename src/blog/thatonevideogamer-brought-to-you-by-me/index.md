Let me explain.

### The Completionist

During my bit of professional soul searching, I rediscovered my true passion for video games. In that time, I found [ThatOneVideoGamer on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPYJR2EIu0_MJaDeSGwkIVw) and really started to look at YouTube and web-based video as a serious entertainment medium.

That lead me to the rest of their shows (links below) which are all professionally done, funny, and genuine. They've set a high standard for web-based videos, and I look forward to them continuing!

Long story short, I wanted to put my money where my mouth is and support this group that make shows that lead me to cancel my cable subscription.

### The Point

No real point other than the team at ThatOneVideoGamer is great and if you like video games and video game humour, you should [check](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPYJR2EIu0_MJaDeSGwkIVw) [out](https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperScopeShow) [their](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThatOneLaserClown) [shows](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheNationalDex).
