When working with NodeJS inside a DevContainer using VSCode, sometimes an error comes up whenever you try to run a node application or npm command (i.e. npm install). The error looks something like this:

> Error: Cannot find module '/some/path/with/ahashvalue/vscode-js-debug-bootloader.js'

It happened to me [on stream a while back](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1241089586) and I've been meaning to share the fix for a while now.

After some searching, this [GitHub Issue](200~https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/issues/374) comes up with the [the following](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/issues/374#issuecomment-622239998) answer to resolve it:

> Because this is happening in tasks, I think you're running into microsoft/vscode#96375. You should be able to fix this by:
>
> 1) Setting debug.node.autoAttach to "disabled" (to clear previous bad state)
> 2) Setting it back to on or off, as you prefer
> 3) Using thewarning icon on the top right to relaunch terminals as desired (or just reopen/reload VS Code)

Follow the steps in the VSCode settings for the DevContainer (i.e. workspace) and it works. Here's an example of me doing it on stream. **Note:** The fix happens right away, but it takes a minute for me to test and confirm it.

Here's hoping this helps someone else out there looking for this solution.

Thanks for playing.
