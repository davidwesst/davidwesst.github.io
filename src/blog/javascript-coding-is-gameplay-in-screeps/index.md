I found this [on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/2m2afe/screeps_the_worlds_first_mmo_sandbox_strategy/) last week. It's called [Screeps](http://screeps.com/) and it comes out tomorrow (November 20th).

It's not just any ordinary Strategy MMO game. Oh no. It's a strategy MMO game you write JavaScript to control your units on screen.

JavaScript _is_ the gameplay.

For realz, yo.

## Brilliant

I code in JavaScript and, although it's biased, I think that everyone should learn JavaScript in some way, shape, or form. Why can't that form be by playing a video game?

I'm planning on getting it on this game early on and possibly revisiting it in a future post this year.

I suggest you give it a whirl too, and look me up!

Thanks for (Hopefully) Playing. ~ DW
