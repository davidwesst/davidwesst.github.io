I wanted to share something I find freaking cool. It's called Awesome Games Done Quickly, or AGDQ.

It's a fund raising marathon, where for an entire week a group of gamers, known as speed runners, play a series of video games as fast as humanly possible. Sometimes is just someone on their own, sometimes it's a race, or sometimes, it's a blindfold challenge (i.e. the person plays the game blindfolded).

Throughout the marathon they accept donations that go towards a charity. This year, they chose the Prevent Cancer Foundation, and 100% of the donations go towards the charity. There isn't anything cut off for administration fees or anything.

As of this writing, they have collected over $530K in donations from people [watching on Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick).

Plus, that doesn't ever include [the Humble Bundle package](https://www.humblebundle.com/) that people can buy and donate other ways.

## Huh?

Don't ask questions. It's an amazing event and I am just blown away by the generosity of the gamer community along with insane skill demonstrated on these games. I mean, beating Mike Tyson's Punch out in 22 minutes? 

Complete insanity. I have yet to even get to Mike Tyson on my own.

## The Point

I just wanted to share this as I find it cool and video games are a real passion of mine. I suggest you [check it out on Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick), or even [donate](https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/donate/12) if you're so inclined.

Thanks for playing. ~ DW
