Check it out! I am a guest author for a three part blog series on getting Ghost 0.5.x running up in Azure cloud on the MSDN's [Canadian Developer Connection blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cdndevs/).

I'll update this post as the rest of the parts are published, but check them out if you want to run an awesome NodeJS blog like me. :)
