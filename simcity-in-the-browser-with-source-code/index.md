If you haven't played the classic [SimCity](http://www.simcity.com/en_US/product/simcity-classic), I mean [Micropolis](https://code.google.com/p/micropolis/) then you missed out.

But you know what would make it cooler? [Playing it in browser](http://micropolisjs.graememcc.co.uk/), that's what.

Yeah, it's already been done (and it continuing to be done) by [Graeme McCutcheon](http://www.graememcc.co.uk/), Mozillian and clearly super awesome dude, based solely on his choice of games to port to HTML5.

But let me show you the coolest thing about [MicropolisJS](http://micropolisjs.graememcc.co.uk/), in my not so humble my opinion.

That's right. [Yours truly contributed](https://github.com/graememcc/micropolisJS/pull/17) to [the project](https://github.com/graememcc/micropolisJS). Booya.

### Uh...Why is that Cool?

Well, SimCity is probably my favourite game of all time. Not the PC one specifically, but the SNES port that came out a bit later.

And I contributed code to it.

In my favourite language.

Sploosh. ([Reference is Kinda NSFW Audio from Archer](http://youtu.be/HC1NqZvY_lA?t=6s))

### You Didn't Contribute Much

True, but I still contributed and that is the point. This represents something else to me.

Plus, having a pull request accepted by an open source project is a new experience for me. If you go back two years, the idea of me being part of anything open source would have been ludacrous.

Now, as more of a coding hobbyist rather than a professional (as I don't get paid to code much anymore), I'm talking open source projects and use not much more than a terminal and text editor to develop and build all my code.

It's something of a major milestone in my personal and professional evolution.

## The Point

It's pretty direct: MicropolisJS is awesome, and so is open source. If you want to be awesome (like me) [fork the project](https://github.com/graememcc/micropolisJS) and help out a bit.

If you don't want to help, it's still a cool set of source code to download and play with to see a full working game in HTML and JavaScript. One that you can really recognize.

Thanks for playing. ~ DW
