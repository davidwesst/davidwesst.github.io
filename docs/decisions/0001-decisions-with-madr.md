# MADR for Documenting Decisions 

## Context and Problem Statement

Decisions regarding the architecture and direction of the project need to be documented and can benefit from a standard format. 

## Considered Options

Considered options based on [GitHub recommendation](https://adr.github.io), which included:

* Markdown Any Decision Record (MADR)
* YStatement
* Nygard

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Markdown Any Decision Record", because it provides the simplest syntax with the flexibility of having as much detail as necessary, depending on the decision.
