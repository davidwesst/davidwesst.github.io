# Cloud Hosting Provider

## Context and Problem Statement

Website hosting should provided by a cloud-based provider that provides a web hosting platform, rather than web hosting infrastructure using virtual machines.

## Considered Options

* Microsoft Azure 
* AWS
* GCP

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Microsoft Azure", because
    the solo dev team (@davidwesst) primarily has experience and familiarity with Microsoft Azure.
